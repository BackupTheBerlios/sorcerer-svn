cdloop is a audio-CD-Player with special looping capabilities intended for 
musicians who want to analyze or play along parts of a CD.  The
boundaries of the looped area on the CD can be adjusted in small steps
and cdloop can pause before repeating the loop again so you ´stay in
the groove´.  You can save your loop boundaries as bookmarks.  cdloop
runs under Linux/X11 with guile-gtk.
