      DESC=("HylaFAX? is for sending and receiving facsimiles like pages."
" The software is designed around a client-server architecture. Fax 
modems may reside on a single machine on a network and clients can 
submit an outbound job from any other machine on the network. Client
 software is designed to be lightweight and easy to port.

HylaFAX? is designed to be very robust and reliable. The fax server 
is designed to guard against unexpected failures in the software, 
in the configuration, in the hardware and in general use. HylaFAX?
 can support multiple modems and a heavy traffic load.

If you expect to send more than a few facsimiles a day, then HylaFAX?
is the fax package for you!!")
