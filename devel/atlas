      DESC=("Atlas aims to produce and display high quality charts of the world"
"designed for users of FlightGear, an open source flight simulator. 
This is achieved through two main parts: The map creator (simply 
called Map) and the Atlas viewer.
The map creator takes scenery data from FlightGear and transforms 
it into beautiful map pictures that can be viewed with any bitmap
image program that you might have installed or with the Atlas viewing
 application.
 
The Atlas viewing application can be used for browsing your maps but
can also connect directly to FlightGear and display your aircrafts 
current location on a so called moving map display. 
 
Atlas is developed as open source under the GNU General Public 
License, which basically means that the software is free. For 
more information on the license, please read the full GNU General
Public License.
