      desc 'wvstreams are C++ libraries used by wvdial.
WvStreams is a library set composed of a number of parts.
Among them are 
WvIPStreams (WvTCPStream and WvUDPStream), 
WvStrings (yet another C++ String class), 
WvCrypto Streams (including an easy way to add SSL support to applications), 
WvConf (a configuration file handler), 
WvLog (nice, simple handling of log files), 
and a whole host of other goodness.
These are the base classes used to build programs such as the
ever popular WvDial, TunnelVision, FastForward, KWvDial, and retchmail.'
