      LONG="
It's a clone of the old DOS game Rampart.
Up to four players (or more in future versions)
build castle walls, place cannons inside these walls,
and shoot at the walls of their enemy(s).
If a player can't build a complete wall 
around one of his castles, he loses.
The last surviving player wins.
