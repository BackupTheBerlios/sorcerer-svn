with info    cite 'library to work with the PDF file format
The name comes from the first letter of PDF (Portable Document Format).
A few tools to work with PDF files are already included in the PoDoFo package.
The PoDoFo library is a free, portable C++ library which includes
classes to parse PDF files and modify their contents into memory.
The changes can be written back to disk easily. The parser can also
be used to extract information from a PDF file (for example the
parser could be used in a PDF viewer). Besides parsing PoDoFo
includes also very simple classes to create your own PDF files.
All classes are documented so it is easy to start writing your own
application using PoDoFo.'
