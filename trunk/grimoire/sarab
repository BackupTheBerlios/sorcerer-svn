      DESC='sarab : Schedule And Rotate Automatic Backups
SaraB works with DAR, Disk ARchive, to schedule and rotate backups 
on random-access media,
i.e. hard drives, CDs, DVDs, Zip, etc,
basically anything except magnetic tapes.
This reduces hassle for the administrator
by providing an automatic backup solution.
SaraB providesa powerful rotation schedule
which allows administrators to create a custom
rotation that fits the needs of their network.
There is no need to worry about manually rotating,
labeling, and properly storing the tapes.
These tedious and routine processes can all be replaced with SaraB.

SaraB supports the Towers of Hanoi, Grandfather-Father-Son,
or any custom backup rotation strategy.
It is easy to use and highly configurable.
SaraB utilizes and requires the great backup program,
DAR, Disk ARchive, by Denis Corbin.

New! Multiple configurations -
Useful to make backups of multiple servers over the network
New! Easy installation - Use the install script to install SaraB in seconds 

Towers of Hanoi: 
Advanced rotation strategy that has
the most efficient use of backup media

Grandfather-Father-Son:
Popular rotation strategy that uses differential
and incremental backups to save space

Custom rotation strategies:
Very powerful, yet simple to create.
Useful examples included.

Differential and incremental backups.

Archive testing to verify that backups
were created without any corruptions.
Email notification when events 
occur, such as backup success and failure.'
