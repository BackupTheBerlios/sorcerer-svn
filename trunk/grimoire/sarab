      DESC=("Schedule And Rotate Automatic Backups" 
"SaraB works with DAR \(Disk ARchive\) to schedule and rotate backups 
on random-access media \(i.e. hard drives, CDs, DVDs, Zip, etc. 
Basically anything except magnetic tapes.\) This reduces hassle for the
administrator by providing an automatic backup solution. SaraB provides
a powerful rotation schedule which allows administrators to create a custom
rotation that fits the needs of their network. There is no need to worry 
about manually rotating, labeling, and properly storing the tapes. These
tedious and routine processes can all be replaced with SaraB.

SaraB supports the Towers of Hanoi, Grandfather-Father-Son, or any custom
backup rotation strategy. It is easy to use and highly configurable. SaraB
utilizes and requires the great backup program, DAR \(Disk ARchive\) by
Denis Corbin.

\(New!\) Multiple configurations - Useful to make backups of multiple 
servers over the network \(New!\) Easy installation - Use the install 
script to install SaraB in seconds 

Towers of Hanoi: Advanced rotation strategy that has the most efficient
use of backup media
Grandfather-Father-Son: Popular rotation strategy that uses differential
and incremental backups to save space
Custom rotation strategies: Very powerful, yet simple to create. Useful
examples included.
Differential and incremental backups
Archive testing to verify that your backups were created without any 
corruptions Email notification when events occur, such as backup success
and failure
