# You may add onto the optional section of REQ 
# However, do not issue --enable-all because:
#   --enable-all            enable all extra options below
# And that can change fuse cups and other optionals into mandtory requirements.

# No: --enable-all is safe because --disable-<something> overrides it.
# So if, for example, fuse is disabled by --without-fuse, it is not going 
# to be built even though --enable-all was given.
# Furthermore, you want --enable-all otherwise most of the usefull 
# bluetooth utilities and daemons are not going to be built. I don't think
# it is sensible to add 30+ optional requirements that you will want 
# anyway for proper functionality. And on top of that, such spell would
# need a very carefull review any time there is a new version of bluez-utils
# to avoid missing anything important again.
