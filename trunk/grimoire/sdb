      DESC="sdb is the game called shotgun debugger.
It is a 2D, top-down action game.
It is The Future, and your habit of computer
network exploration has finally done you in.
You are captured and taken to a strange
underground complex populated by robot soldiers.
Your task is to escape the facility--but the hordes
of walking death machines aren't just gonna let you."
