/etc/hostname is the FQDN, fully qualified domain name, for the computer.
/etc/rootname is the same idea as a hostname.
However,         the FQDN in /etc/rootname
must differ from the FQDN in /etc/hostname

If the hostname for a computer is muffins.eat
then the rootname for the main root file system
could be main.muffins.eat
However, the rootname could also be entirely different.
It could be pets.hostel-haven.org

Each root file system must have an /etc/rootname
The content of /etc/rootname must be unique.
No two or more root file systems can share the same rootname.
