ln is the command that creates symbolic links.
A symbolic link is synonymous with the prase "short cut."
However, a symbolic link is simply
an alternate root to reach a destination.
It is not necessarily shorter
unless the name for the symbolic link
is shorting in length than typing the true path.

Many of the suggested doucments have a length path.
This document explains how to create symbolic links
so that the symbolic link can be used
to arive at the desired location
within a file system for less typing.

A symbolic link can point to
a directory, file, device node, pipe,
or even another symbolic link.
A symbolic link can be granted the same relative name
as it's desgination or it can differ.
Consequently, a symbolic link has nearly unlimited flexibility
for easing navigation of a file system.

First change the present working directory to the home directory
for the root account.
That is accomplished by typing cd and pressing enter.
The instructions can be typed on a different virtual console
or noted for entry after this document is completed.

Next, type the command:

ln -s /usr/share/doc/ d

This document that was accessed with the command:

less /usr/share/doc/deployment-docent/ln

can be viewed with the command:

less d/docent/ln

After noting the above commands press q;
then execute the commands and resume reading.

To avoid typing docent repeatedly create another symbolic link:

ln -s /usr/share/doc/deployment-docent/ dd

And now this document can be viewed with the command:

less dd/ln

Another directory with useful documentation
is the Linux's documentation directory
Create that symbolic link with the command:

ln -s /usr/src/linux/Documentation l

In summary the four commands to create
the symbolic links that will be referenced
during deployment are:

cd
ln -s /usr/share/doc d
ln -s /usr/share/doc/deployment-docent dd
ln -s /usr/src/linux/Documentation l

The font rendering of the lower case L
looks similar to the number 1.
While numbers could be used for symbolic links,
this documentation uses the lower case L
as the symbolic link to Linux provided documentation.
 
ln invoked without the -s parameter creates hard links.
Hard links are less flexible than symbolic links.
Hard links to directories are forbidden!
If ln prints an error message
then re-invoke ln with the -s parameter.

A symbolic link without a valid destination can be created.
No error is generated for creating an invalid symbolic link.
Therefore, carefully check spelling.

If the symbolic link is incorrectly created
then the symbolic link can be removed with the rm command.

The command:

rm dd

removes the symbolic link called dd
that was created to point to /usr/share/doc/deployment-docent/

Few users utilize symbolic links.
However, every SA utilizes symbolic links.
Being able to wield symbolic links is valuable lore.
