Nobody memorizes devices.txt.
Most SAs use it as a reference.
Only frequently used device names are memorized.
Disk device node name and partition device node name are memorized.
For now memorize the nomenclature.

/dev/sda is the device node name for the first  fixed disk.
/dev/sdb is the device node name for the second fixed disk.
/dev/sdc is the device node name for the third  fixed disk.
Few boxes would have more than 26 fixed disks installed.

Specifying the partition of a fixed disk is easy.
fixed disks can have as between none and 128 partitions.
The partition number is appended to the device name.
Consequently, the first partition of the first disk is /dev/sda1
And the second partition of the third    fixed disk is /dev/sdc2

Memorization of device major and minor codes are optional.
Definitely memorize device names.
If the moment arrives when
the SA must manually create a device node
then the major and minor hexadecimal values
can be discovered by reading the devices.txt file.

While the udevd program runs;
modifications to devices such as partitioning
will automatically update of device node names in /dev/
Likewise hot-plugging a device also allows the device
to receive a node in /dev/

If they do not appear then try running:

/etc/init.d/udevd start; /etc/init.d/udevdtrigger start

Deployment to a portable SSD is possible.
Familiarity with the use of UUIDs and labels is useful.
SSD can receive a different device node name in /dev/
each time it is removed and added.
