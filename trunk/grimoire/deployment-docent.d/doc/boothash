Placing a password on the boot loader
hinders someone with keyboard access
from gaining administrator rights
by rebooting a computer with kernel parameter
rdinit=/bin/bash

When a password exists
then the boot loader will prompt for the password
before loading the non default label.
After the password is supplied then a non default label
can be booted or edited to append or modify kernel parameters.

The boot password should not be stored anywhere in clear text.
Therefore, the password is not stored in the configuration file.
Instead a md5 hash of the password is stored in the configuration file.
Provided that the same password is entered
then the md5 hash of the password matches
the md5 hash in the configuration file.
If an unauthorized person looks at the configuration file
the password can not become evident by recording the md5 hash.

Before installing the boot loader
setting a boot password is advised.
Otherwise the default boot password
will remain as "sorcerer"

Substitute something clever for $password.
Execute the following command

md5crypt <<< "$password"

The output begins with
$1$NaCl$
The entire string is the md5 hash of the password.
This time put it someplace useful such as the content of a variable:

HASH="$( md5crypt <<< "$password" )"

The output of md5crypt is now stored in the variable $HASH
To verify that it is then execute
echo $HASH

The following command edits the configuration file:

sed -i "s|PASSWD.*|PASSWD\t$HASH|" /etc/extlinux/head

Look carefully at the above command and notice
the locations of the 3 pipe symbols and one backslash symbol.
And literally type $HASH rather than trying to manually
substitute the hash value displayed on a line above.

Verify a successful edit with the command:
echo $HASH; grep PASSWD /etc/extlinux/head

The same hash should be shown twice.

Memorize the boot password.
Never write it.
Only type it when prompted to do so.

Computers normally boot without prompting for the boot password.
Therefore, the boot password remains
a security measure rather than an inconvenience.
However, if the computer is unable to boot the default label
then trying the other labels requires the boot password.
Without the boot password the above scenario
can be fixed only by booting an DI, Deployment Image.

A variation or mutation of the root password
can become a sensible possibility for the boot password.
The system administrator might enter root's password
several times each day.
However, a boot password might only be entered quarterly.
A unique boot password requires infrequent changing.
