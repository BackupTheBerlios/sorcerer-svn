Welcome to the Modern Magic deployment docent.
A docent is a teaching assistant and a tour guide.
Step by step guidance is provided.

Unix is a multi-user operating system.
POSIX means portable operating system for UNIX.
POSIX are compatible with UNIX.
Source code designed to be compiled on UNIX
can be compiled on a POSIX with few modifications.
Compilation translates human readable source code
into computer executable instructions.

Software teaches computers to perform roles.
A software project is a person or group of individuals
that design and implement computer code.
Frequently, the phrase "software project"
can refer both or either the people or the computer code.
The surrounding context provides clues.
Press the space key to display additional text.

The words program and command are synonymous.
Command names are POSIX argot.
Argot is the collection of words
specific to an experience, occupation, or profession.
Documentation suggested by the deployment docent
demystifies the argot of POSIX.

Many useful commands exist.
Understanding argot is important.
Please use the argot command to gain understanding
of unknown or potentially misunderstood words.

Wielding the power of POSIX requires acquisition of lore.
Lore is not merely the comprehension of argot.
Lore is also the skill for wielding argot.
Failure to master argot causes failure to acquire lore.
Failure to acquire lore causes failed deployment.
Therefore, the cause of a failed deployment
is most frequently failure to understand argot.
However, a typo or omitted step could also cause failure.

Invest the time to read and comprehend.
A carpenter's cliche is,      "measure twice cut     once."
Please consider the value of, "read    twice execute once."
The best odds for a uniformed conjecture are 50%.
Therefore, re-read when misunderstanding occurs
and research words with a dictionary when possible.
Never guess when certainty can be acquired.

Deployment copies a POSIX to a mass storage device.
Pre-deployed POSIX provide compressed or packaged software.
Deployment is necessary for the use and update of most software.
Deployment also grants roles to a computer.

Modern Magic is a POSIX that provides free software.
Download Modern Magic for free from http://sorcerer.silverice.org/
If provides on SSD, CDROM, or fixed disk
then then the cost should be for the physical device.
"Modern Magic" is not sold and is not for sale.

The docent recognizes the following commands:
argot; ask; docs; hint; test; fore; yore.
"argot"	provides a vocabulary list.
"ask"	provides definitions.
"docs"	suggests commands for reading documentation.
"hint"	suggests commands useful for completing the current task.
"test"	performs a test when a test exists for  the current task.
	A test can verify the current task was successfully completed.
"fore"	advances  to the next     task.
"yore"	regresses to the previous task.

Every typed command is executed by the "Bourne Again Shell."
BASH is a shell.
A shell is an interactive command interpreter.

Typing "docs" and pressing enter provides
a list of suggested commands.
To view a document file
type the displayed command.
# and what follows on the same line represents a comment.
The comment should be omitted.

Commands not presented in the prompt remain valid.
When prepared to advanced to the next step
the "fore" command should be entered.
The "fore" command is removed from the menu.
Executed   commands become learned commands.
While no longer provided on the menu
the "fore" command remains valid.

Trimming the menu mitigates the probability
of important information scrolling above
the displayed portion of the virtual console.

The console is the screen, monitor, or display.
Several consoles are provided.
The device can display only one.

The currently displayed console
can be changed by pressing key combinations.
A separate document describes console utilization.
The command to view the document is:
xz -cd /usr/share/tldp/Keyboard-and-Console-HOWTO.xz | less

Do not type the command at this time.
The currently running command is less.
"less" is currently displaying the intro document.
Additional documents will be viewed later.

The word system administrator is abbreviated as SA.
SAs' responsibilities are:
deploying operating systems;
software configuration;
software updates;
software performance monitoring;
defective hardware replacement.

Tasks are accepted prior to acquisition of lore.
Lore required for  successful completion
is acquired concurrently with completion.
Failures become learning experiences.
Challenges are repeatedly confronted.
A successful outcome is ultimately achieved.
The SA role is a combination of scholar and adventurer.

The ability to deploy a POSIX is standard SA lore.
The experience of deployment varies with each POSIX.
The experience of deployment varies with experience.
Tenacious people are rewarded with sweet victory.
Everyone else accepts an outcome commensurate
with one's own self expectations.

A neophyte SA could perceive deployment
as an endless amount of tasks
each involving an insurmountable challenge.
However, by assimilating the lore;
each challenge can be successfully accomplished.
What began as daunting experience
can be savored as a fantastic adventure of learning and achievement.
Those who achieve deployment and master administration tasks
should feel welcomed into the cabal of those who wield Modern Magic.

Additional opportunities for receiving help
can be acquired by joining the email lists,
interacting with other SAs,
reading the documentation hosted at
"The Linux Documentation Project" website,
reading documentation hosted at software authors' websites,
reading documentation provided in software tarballs,
reading installed documentation,
reading manual and info pages,
doing google searches, and more.

Learning is an available to everyone.
Books, compact disks, videos, and classes are superfluous.
The splendor of free software provides
both the software and documentation freely.

Modern Magic is merely one approach
for creating and providing a POSIX.
Many different POSIX exist.
Each specializes in one or more niches.

The path of Modern Magic emphasizes mastery of lore.
Masters of Modern Magic acquire lore applicable
to the deployment and administration of many POSIX.
The majority of learning focuses upon command line tools
common among all POSIX.

If the challenge seems insurmountable do not lament.
Many fine POSIX exist.
No POSIX is the best POSIX.
Each POSIX attempts to fulfill one or more niches.
At least two or more POSIX compete in every niche.
While nearly an identical selections of software is provided;
the experience of deployment and administration can vary.

Modern Magic is intended to please
those who possess the pinnacle of lore.
Secondary niches are:
achieving performance from powerful computers;
updating using slow or expensive Internet connections;
providing lore to those capable of assimilating it.

Packages are not provided.
Package manager programs are not provided.
This is a source based POSIX.

Erudite Technic is a tool for source based administration.
System Administrators wield Erudite Tools.

Allow ample patience and persistence during deployment.
A  journeyman completes in mere minutes.
An apprentice completes in mere hours.
A  neophyte   completes in mere days.
The duration  depends upon the  rate
at which lore can be assimilated.

At the time of writing this document
a recent deployment required about an hour.
Accomplishments were:
creating backups;
creating 24 partitions;
created several file systems;
creating 2 swap systems;
initializing LUKS encrypted devices;
creating 6 real file systems;
restoring from backups.
Complexity elongated duration.
The re-deployment of a workstation
exceeded the complexity of most first time deployments.
The simple plan used during testing
required mere minutes to complete.

The proper time to attempt deployment
is when nothing urgent is expected to occur.
Allocate 8 hours.
Complete deployment in 1.5 hours.
Gain the title of "Miracle Worker."
When deployment progresses smoothly the extra hours can be spent
savoring the flavor of vintage TLDP documentation.

"The Linux Documentation Project" website
tends to provide vintage documentation.
Concepts might remain similar.
Argot might remain the same.
However, command names might entirely differ.

Documents from a tldp   subdirectory describe historical methods.
Documents from a docent subdirectory describe current    methods.
That distinction should help mitigate confusion
when a TLDP method fails to achieve the intended outcome.

A tarball is a file comprised of one or more files
concatenated together using a format described as "tar."
Files within a tarball can be extracted and installed separately.

Current documentation can be found
at a software project's website,
within the software project's source tarball,
within   a separate   documentation  tarball,
in manual pages, in info pages,
or by running software with the --help command line parameter.

Journeyman SAs read documents from the above sources
Neophytes tend to read TLDP provided documents.
TLDP documents provides sufficient definition for the argot they present.
More succinctly stated TLDP documentation
is intended to be understood by complete neophytes.

Unfortunately, TLDP's archive receives few updates over the decades.
TLDP became something of a quasi historical curiosity.
However, every new SA is encouraged to read TLDP documents.

The docent suggestions include both vintage and current documents.
A prudent approach is to read the vintage documentation first.
Read the current documentation last.
Follow the instructions provided in the current documentation.

The docent is intended to be a useful boon.
It is like training wheels on a bicycle.
Eventually, deployment can be accomplished
without utilizing the docent.
Sorcerers are expected to design and implement
their own method for efficient mass deployment.
