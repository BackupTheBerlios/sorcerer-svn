Before a file system can be mounted
a mount point must exist.
A mount point is a directory.
A mount point can be created using the mkdir command.

Directories acting as a mount point are typically empty.
If not empty then content becomes
occluded upon a successful mount.

A far more confusing aspect of POSIX nomenclature is,
what is root?
root can refer to many things.
Foremost, / or // are referred to as the root directory.
root is also the name of system administration account.
root is also the name of the system administration group.
And /root/ is the name of the home directory for the
system administration account.

The current file system
is not a real file system.
It is the rootfs file system.
However, the deployment image rootfs is unusual.
It contains nearly every file
that would be present on a real file system.

initramfs images that populate the rootfs
are created from the /+/base/ file system.
In a pre-deployed state the real file system
will be created from the contents of the rootfs.

Part of the deployment process is to create a /+/base/
Since rootfs is already mounted as /
real file system must be mounted elsewhere.
Consequently, the mount point becomes
/+/base/

The command to create the mount point is:

mkdir -pm 755 /+/base/

Before the initialized file system can be mounted
please create the mount point using the aforementioned command.

If deploying with multiple real file systems
then create the mount point for each real file system.

For example, to create:
/+/base/
/+/food/
/+/test/
/+/work/

the command becomes:

mkdir -pm 755 /+/{base,food,test,work}/

Every real file system is mounted on a direct subdirectory of /+/
Using /+/ simply avoids confusion so that if the same
file system appears at different places due to a bind
then only the one as an immediate subdirectory of /+/
becomes initialized during runlevel.
