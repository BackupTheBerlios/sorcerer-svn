Before a file system can be mounted
a mount point must exist.
A mount point is a directory.
A mount point can be created using the mkdir command.

Directories acting as a mount point are typically empty.
If not empty then content becomes
occluded upon a successful mount.

A far more confusing aspect of POSIX nomenclature is,
what is root?
root can refer to many things.
Foremost, / or // are referred to as the root directory.
root is also the name of system administration account.
root is also the name of the system administration group.
And /root/ is the name of the home directory for the
system administration account.

The current file system
is not a root file system.
It is the rootfs file system.
However, it is unusual for a rootfs.
It contains nearly every file
that would be present on a root file system.

On a deployed box the initramfs images that populates
the rootfs are created from the root file system.
In a pre-deployed state the root file system
will be created from the contents of the rootfs.

Part of the deployment process is to create a root file system.
Since rootfs is already mounted as /
the root file system must be mounted elsewhere.
Consequently, the mount point becomes
/+/base/

The command to create the mount point is:

mkdir -pm 755 /+/base/

Before the initialized root file system can be mounted
please create the mount point using the aforementioned command.

If deploying with multiple root file systems
then create the mount point for each root file system.
