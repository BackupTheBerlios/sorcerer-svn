If a desktop environment was installed
and the desktop environment includes
a GUI login program such as gdm, kdm, xdm
then changing the default run level to 4 or 5
is required for the program to execute during boot.
The command for that is either:

nano /etc/inittab

And then manually make the change and save it.

Otherwise the file can be edited
using the stream editor called sed with the command:

sed -i 's/id:[0-9]:/id:5:/' /etc/inittab

Additional caution is advised while typing the above command.
Otherwise the outcome might not become as expected.

Verify that the init default run level changed to 5
with the command

grep '^id:' /etc/inittab

If it says 3 then it was not changed.
Try using nano instead.
Editing the file with nano provides
an opportunity for reading the comments
which describe what the various run levels achieve.

For more information about /etc/inittab execute the command:

man inittab

If a configuration file should be reverted to stock defaults
then a command for that is:

aurum uncustom

The following parameter to uncustom aurum command module
can be a path name or the name of a technic.
A technic name as parameter cause all the configuration
files for that technic to be uncustomized.

aurum uncustom /etc/inittab

The above command reverts /etc/inittab to stock.
However, it only works if the stock file exists in
/aux/new/
Therefore, the above uncustom request would cause
/aux/new/etc/inittab to be copied to /etc/
and replace the one that was modified.

Stock configuration files are saved.
A decent sized collection requires between 1 and 10 megabytes.
Saving them in /aux/new/
also provides the SA with an opportunity to examine
the stock configuration file and see how the
currently customized configuration file differs.
A command that could do that would be something like

diff {,/aux/new}/etc/inittab

The above command executes with bracket expansion as if
the above command was typed as:

diff /etc/inittab /aux/new/etc/inittab

If a currently customized configuration file is not working
then the SA might decide to save it to a different name,
revert to stock and then customize the stock configuration file.
That can be useful when doing major upgrades of httpd for example.
Some programs allow for additional configuration files to be specified
which allows minimizing the amount of lines modified in the
the software installed configuration file.
With httpd often that can be the addition of a single line
at the end which includes a separate file.
And that separate file includes additional separate files.
When possible to store customized configurations in separate files
then that minimizes the chance that the customization will be lost
or accidentally overwritten due to a bug.

Typically, /etc/inittab is modified
when a different default run level is desired.
However, the run level can also be specified as a kernel parameter.
Therefore, the run level can be entered using extlinux's menus
before the kernel is loaded.

Historically /etc/inittab described gettys
that should be started during run levels.
However, the concept of assigning gettys to virtual consoles
is inconvenient for a POSIX that supports multiple root file systems.
Consequently, this POSIX provides logind which
conveniently launches login programs on available virtual consoles.
