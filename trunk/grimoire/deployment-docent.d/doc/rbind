Following step involves executing chrooted commands.
Execution of the commands require
/dev /proc and /sys to be mounted.

A mount command should suffice.
However, binds are more easily unmounted.
The follow commands bind
/dev /proc and /sys into /+/base:

mkdir -pm 755   /+/base/{dev,proc,sys}/
mount --rbind {,/+/base}/dev
mount --rbind {,/+/base}/proc
mount --rbind {,/+/base}/sys

Execution of the above commands completes this step.

Explanation of BASH parenthesis expansion follows.
The parenthesis allows expansion.

mount --rbind {,/+/base}/dev

expands to:

mount --rbind /dev /+/base/dev

The concise format is convenient.
After entering the first command,
I press up arrow, backspace 3 times, type proc, and press enter.
That completes the second command.
Then I press up arrow, backspace 4 times, type dev, and press enter.
And just like that all 3 mount --bind commands are executed
faster than typing and editing each command
without using bash parenthesis expansion.
It is only remains confusing until a SA becomes
too lazy to type the commands the longer way.

BTW, the mkdir command expands to
mkdir -pm 755 /+/base/dev /+/base/proc /+/base/sys
Convinced of the convenience, yet?

The directories already existed
if the cp was successful.
The mkdir command could have been omitted.
But it helps make the point.
And creating a mount point
or verifying it's existence
is a task that should be accomplished
prior to issuing a mount command.
