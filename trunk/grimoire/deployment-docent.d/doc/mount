File systems exist on block devices.
File systems are joined to the current
file system hierarchy by mounting a
file system on a mount point.

The following commands mounts the second
partition of the first fixed disk on /+/base/ :

mkdir -p /+/base/; mount /dev/sda2 /+/base

If the plan delegates / to a different partition
such as the third partition then the command becomes:

mkdir -p /+/base/; mount /dev/sda3 /+/base

Be certain to mount the correct partition.
Mounting the partition delegated for /boot as /+/base/
causes deployment failure.

To verify that the file system is mounted execute the command:

df

/+/base should be listed in the output.

Now that /+/base/ is mounted
also mount the boot partition.
The commands for that should be evident yes?

mkdir -pm 700 /+/base/boot/; mount /dev/sda1 /+/base/boot

Please mount all the file systems specified in the selected plan.
Proper mounting order is essential!
