Achieving comprehension for the bash manual page
might be the most difficult challenge for a SA.
Acquiring the lore for /sbin/ip
and deciphering it's manual pages
was more challenging for me.

/sbin/ip can be used for immediate network configuration.
/sbin/dhcpcd can also be used for immediate network configuration.
Either is a fine idea if wanting
to immediately download files.
However, other methods exist
for creating a network connection
that automatically configures itself on each boot.

The network templates provide a method
for static and dynamic network configurations.
Fallback can be created so that mobile computer
can connect with multiple networks.
Or if a computer should connect to any available network
and receive network configuration information from a DHCP server
then nothing further is required.

/etc/init.d/auto-networks runs dhcpcd
on every wired and wireless network adapter.
Of course contacting a DHCP server fails
when a network requires an encryption key.
A menu driven interface exists
to assist with WPA configuration.
The command is:

/etc/init.d/wpa_supplicant configure

The opportunity to configure wpa_supplicant
was probably offered during booting.
However, macho SAs prefer running the commands:

man wpa_supplicant
mkdir -p /etc/wpa_supplicant/
nano     /etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf

The only way to be absolutely certain
that the configuration file is correct
is to personally edit it
instead of leaning upon the crutch
of a menu driven interface.

If the networks are not using WPA encryption
then skip creating a WPA configuration file.
If the networks are using WEP encryption
then consider purchasing network hardware
that is less than a decade old.

Configuration of network adapters
must happen during sysinit.
Best for it to happen before VETH are created.
Whatever works becomes the proper method.

However, do not edit files that already exist
in /etc/init.d/
Customized init-scripts are not preserved
when installed software updates.
Modifications to any configuration file in /etc/
are preserved during software updates.
However, init-scripts are NOT configuration files.
Therefore, a custom init-script must have a unique name.

udevd rule files can also be used
for configuring network adapters
at the moment that udevd detects the hardware.
However, I have not attempted network configuration using udevd.

Some SAs want to use NetworkManager
or a GUI program that configures NetworkManager.
NetworkManager has heavy ELF library requirements.
Consequently, NetworkManager is not available on the rootfs.
Forget about NetworkManager.

Not all SAs like network configuration.
However, all SAs can accomplish network configuration.
When in doubt ask on an email list or IRC channel.

If all the documentation and manual pages are read
then an average person has a very good chance
of being able to accomplish network configuration.
A 50% chance of success or better exists.
The longer a person continues trying
the more favorable the odds become.

Anyone who can accomplish the task
would not describe network configuration as difficult.
For a SA that seldom attempts network configuration
then accomplishing the task could require extra tenacity.

Post deployment network configuration becomes slightly more complex.
To make a change that is effective on the next boot
requires login to /+/base/ and editing files there.
Making a change for an immediate immediate effect
requires login to / the rootfs.
Login to / is required to effect a change because
the actual network adapters exist in the rootfs.

Having multiple network namespace might seem inconvenient
when compared to computers that have only one network stack
where the Ethernet and wireless adapters immediately accessible.
However, enduring the inconvenience provides additional security.
The rootfs acts as a firewall.
Therefore, if unexpected software
binds without permission to a port
then no packets will reach that port unless
the computer's firewall rules are adjusted.

Instructions are provided at a later step
for configuring port forwarding of packets
through the firewall.
This step is successfully completed
when networking is configured to begin on each boot.
