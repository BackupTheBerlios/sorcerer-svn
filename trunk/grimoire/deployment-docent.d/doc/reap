Reap removes a software project's installed files.
Two types of reap events exist.
"Reap Void" event is when when files are removed without     installing others.
"Reap Omit" event is when files      are removed prior to re-installing.

A software project can be re-installed for several reasons.
A software project can be updated to a newer version.
A software project method for installation could change.
A software project installed files may be linked with
older shared libraries which are no longer installed.

If a software project installed files provide shared libraries
then an update that change a shared library soname, shared object name,
causes "Miss ELF" events.
A "Miss ELF" event is when an installed software project files
link with a shared library that is no longer installed.

"Miss ELF" events are extremely common.
"Miss ELF" events are not an error indication.
"Miss ELF" events are automatically fixed.
Effected software projects re-compile and re-link.
The cascade of updates ensures that installed software projects
properly communicate with each other.

To provide a flexible deployment;
the DI, Deployment Image, provides more software projects
than are required deployment.

Each root file system must provide
installed software projects used during software updating.
/+/base/ root file system must also provide
installed software projects that are used during sysinit.

A non /+/base/ root file system does not require /lib/modules/ and /boot/
However, xorg-server may attempt to load DRM modules.
Ideally, /+/base/etc/rootfs/fstab should bind
/+/base/lib/modules/ to the same location within each root file system.
That way each root file system can load modules.
Otherwise modules specified in file /+/base/etc/rootfs/modules
are loaded during sysinit.

Before using reap to remove an installed software project's files
be certain to asceratin the purpose of the software project.
Next verify that the software project is no longer required.
# au lone
The above command prints the names of installed software projects
that are not required by another installed software project.
Finally, evalaute that the installed software project is not desired.

When a spell is removed from the catalog
then immune-exam-reap can automatically remove
the software project's installed files.
Years of deployment accumulates some
yet not a significant amount
of unused yet installed software projects.

Seems too much to immediately grasp?
That is a common feeling among neophytes.
Software projects such as bash, binutils, gcc, make, ncurses, readline
are essentail for development and must remain installed
yet neophyte SAs are unaware of what each provides.

The most important software projects are required
by the installed software project called "core."
"core" is a profile.
A profile installs other software projects.
A profile only logs itself as being installed
A profile itself does not provide useful software.

If "core" is installed then the list of lone spells
excludes software projects required by "core."
"core" provides a modest amount of protection.
However, reap will remove installed files
for any software project regardless
of whether that software project is required.

firmware linux-{kernel,modules,firmware} initramfs
software projects can reap on non /+/base/ root file systems.
Afterwards, run
# augur merge
so that the core spell's requirement list
no longer contain the above spells.
Reap of the aforementioned software projects on
/+/base/ will render /+/base/ useless.
/+/base/ will require redeployment from a DI.
Reap can not be undone.
Exercise caution.

Removing superfluous installed software projects on /+/base/
reduces the size of initramfs images.
Smaller initramfs images generate faster and load faster.
Removing superfluous installed software projects from non /+/base/
root file systems allows for faster updates, better performance,
and provides more available space.
The software projects installed on /+/base/
used entirely for booting utilize nearly 1G of space.
