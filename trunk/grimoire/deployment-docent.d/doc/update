Before selecting additional software projects for installation
always update     installed software projects.
An update ensures that software selected for installation
will be the most currently available versions
instead of the available versions when the DI, Deployment Image, was generated.
Having updated installed software projects that provide shared libraries
minimizes the amount of "Miss ELF" events.

The command to update installed software is simply:
# augur sync

However, if only the software catalog
and source administration tools should be updated
then the command is:
# augur catalog

The first acquisition of the software catalog
involves the acqusition of several thousand files.
Updates of the catalog downloads only newer files.

The software catalog is not provided on the DI.
Acqusition of the software catalog ensures
that software selected for installation is current.
Omission of the software catalog conserves space.
The software catalog is not required
during the first portion of deployment.
From this point forward a software catalog is required.
