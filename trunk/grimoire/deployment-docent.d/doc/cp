The cp command is used to copy files from the rootfs
to the currently empty and new root file systems.
It should look something like:

cp -ax / /+/base/

If a halt or an error suggests that RAM is depleted
then that indicates a file system
was NOT mounted on the destination directory.

Each step must be successfully completed
to achieve successful deployment.
Remember to copy rootfs content
to every root file system.
Empty root file systems remain useless until populated.

cp will print an error message such as
cp: will not create hard link '/+/base/var/run' to directory '/+/base/run'

Because of the bind from /run/ to /var/run/
The two directories appear to have the same inode.
If any two files or any two directories share the same inode
then the assumption is that they are hard linked.
Hard linked files are allowed.
Hard linked files are common.
Symbolic linked files are more common.

Hard links are like two separate roads that lead to the same village.
A symbolic link is like a detour sign that
indicates the proper path deviates from expectations.

cp generates an error message because
hard linked directories are forbidden.
Since creating hard linked directories
is possible yet taboo
the cp command refuses to have those destination
directories point to the same inode.

The error message could be regarded as a bug in cp.
But it is more like a misunderstanding than a bug.
A printed error message is not always an indication
that the outcome was less than successful.
In this odd instance the outcome probably was successful.

Try running the command:

df /+/base

If the current usage of 1K blocks
is about a million or more
and cp printed no other error messages
then all the files probably copied.

/bin/cp is from the coreutils software project.
Anyone is welcome to report the error message
to the coreutils software project email list.
I expect that the reply might be something like,
"umount the bind directory before issuing the cp command."
Consequently, I decided to not report the misunderstanding.
Instead I am pleased that cp
refused to create hard linked directories.

SAs must gain sufficient lore so that the
sometimes confusing error messages
can be properly evaluated and understood.
Most of the time most software works as expected.
Some of the time it does not.
The SA decides whether a problem or bug actually occurred.

Do not forget to copy the rootfs content
to all the root file systems
and not merely /+/base/
However, each root file system must be provided
a unique rootname.
Therefore, edit /etc/rootname before copying files.
The command would be:

nano /etc/rootname
