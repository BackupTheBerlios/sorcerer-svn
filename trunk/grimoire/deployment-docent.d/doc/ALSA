ALSA stands for the Advanced Linux Sound Architecture.
ALSA is available only on Linux.
ALSA has 4 layers of integration.

The first layer of integration is firmware.
Firmware is additional instruction code.
Code from firmware runs on the microprocessor
or the processors on hardware.
Some audio hardware requires firmware.
Required firmware is automatically loaded
when Linux kernel modules for devices are loaded.
Firmware is is provided by technics:
alsa-firmware; linux-firmware; and firmware.

The second layer of integration are Linux kernel modules.
Linux kernel modules are additional instruction code
for devices and protocols that can be loaded
into the running kernel.
Some Linux kernel modules can also be unloaded when not in use.
The modular design of the Linux kernel conserves utilization
of RAM, random access memory.

Audio devices are driven by Linux kernel driver modules.
The ALSA software project's Linux kernel modules source code
is already integrated with Linux source code.
Therefore, linux-modules provides the Linux kernel module.
Most sound hardware is already supported.

The third layer of integration is library.
A library provide instruction codes that is loaded into RAM.
Code from a library can be utilized by one or more processes.
The technic alsa-lib provides the library
which is used by software that outputs audio through ALSA.

The final layer is the program layer.
Several audio programs exist.
Some adjust mixer levels, others record and most output audio.
Several technics provide audio programs.
The audio programs expected to be installed
are provided by the technic alsa-utils.

During runlevel start audio firmware and modules
are automatically loaded into Linux.
Run the program alsaconf if audio modules did not load.

The volume level for an audio device
can be adjusted with the command:

alsa-mixer

Connect speakers or headphones and
the output can be tested with the command:

speaker-test -t wav -c 6 -l 1

Retry the test with alternate physical audio ports
until audio output is heard.

Hardware attaches by a data bus.
Audio hardware attachs to the PCI or USB bus.
Devices can be displayed on each bus
with the following commands:

lspci -v -v | less
lsusb -v -v | less

Knowing the installed hardware is useful
if alsaconf fails automatic detection.

Loaded kernel modules can be listed with the command:

lsmod | less

Kernel modules can be loaded with the command:

modprobe

where the parameter for modprobe
is the name of a Linux kernel module.
Omit typing the .ko filename extention.
If manually loading a module
then the firmware also loads.
If an error occurred when a module loaded
then that error might be still be in the kernel's ring buffer.
The ring buffer can be displayed with the command:

dmesg

Most mainboards provide a built-in audio controller.
Onboard audio devices attach via the PCI or USB bus.
More than one audio device could be present.

If audio does not yet work
then it can be configured after deployment
by running alsaconf while logged into /+/base/

On the Deployment Image file system
music from the software project
"Battle for Wesnoth" is provided.
mocp, a music playing program, is also provided.
The command to play the music is:

mocp -l /usr/share/music/*

To end the music prior to completion the command is:

mocp -x
