ALSA stands for the Advanced Linux Sound Architecture.
ALSA is available only on Linux.
ALSA has 4 layers of integration.

The first layer of integration is firmware.
Some audio hardware requires firmware.
If required then firmware must be loaded.
Firmware for audio cards are installed by:
alsa-firmware; linux-firmware; and firmware.

The second layer of integration is modules.
Audio devices are driven by Linux kernel driver modules.
The ALSA software project's Linux kernel modules source code
is already integrated with Linux source code.
Therefore, linux-modules provides the Linux kernel module.
Most sound hardware is already supported.

The third layer is the ALSA software library.
The sotware library provides convenient and useful functions.
alsa-lib provides the third layer.

The final layer are audio programs.
The programs adjust mixer levels, record and output audio.
Audio programs are provided by alsa-utils.
However, many other sotware projects
that input and output audio
also link with alsa-lib and provide programs.

During the transition to runlevel 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5
audio firmware and modules
appropriate for installed hardware
load into Linux.
Run the program alsaconf
if audio modules did not load.

The volume level for an audio device
can be adjusted with the command:

alsa-mixer

Connect speakers or headphones and
the output can be tested with the command:

speaker-test -t wav -c 6 -l 1

Retry the test with alternate physical audio ports
until audio output is heard.

Hardware attaches by a data bus.
Audio hardware attachs to the PCI or USB bus.
Devices can be displayed on each bus
with the following commands:

lspci -v -v | less
lsusb -v -v | less

Knowing the installed hardware is useful
if alsaconf fails automatic detection.

Loaded kernel modules can be listed with the command:

lsmod | less

Kernel modules can be loaded with the command:

modprobe

where the parameter for modprobe
is the name of a Linux kernel module.
Omit typing the .ko filename extention.
If manually loading a module
then the firmware also loads.
If an error occurred when a module loaded
then that error might be still be in the kernel's ring buffer.
The ring buffer can be displayed with the command:

dmesg

Most motherboards provide a built-in audio controller.
Onboard audio devices attach via the PCI or USB bus.
More than one audio device could be present.

If audio does not yet work
then it can be configured after deployment
by running alsaconf on the /+/base/ root file system.

On the Deployment Image file system
music from the software project called "Battle for Wesnoth" is provided.
mocp, a music playing program, is also provided.
The command to play the music is:

mocp -l /usr/share/music/*

To end the music prior to completion the command is:

mocp -x
