Thousands of software projects can be easily installed.
However, installing a software project requires
knowledge of the software project's name.
The name can be acquired by grepping the software catalog
or grepping software with specific roles or traits.
That is what SAs do.

However, non SAs and those that come from fluffy GUI
for everything type POSIX will prefer the menu driven interface
that is provided by sorcery.

Sorcery can browse spells for software project by role
and can include or exclude spells that have specific traits.
Sorcery is an amusing tool for exploration.
It is useful for configuration.
It is convenient for selecting installed software projects
that should be uninstalled.

SAs are encouraged to wield augur.
augur is fast and precise.
However, since the sorcery menu driven tools are provided
then sorcery can also be used to fill the queues.
And sorcery can invoke augur to begin action on the queues.

If sorcery's menus seem less than ideal
then that is because nobody is using it.
If a bug is discovered
then please report the bug.
Otherwise the bug will go unnoticed.
Because, nobody uses sorcery's menu driven interface.
While sorcery's menu driven interface is good for novices;
please remember that SAs learn how to wield augur.
