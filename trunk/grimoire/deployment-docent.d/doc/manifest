Thousands of software projects can be easily installed.
However, installing a software project requires
knowledge of the software project's name.
The name can be acquired by grepping the software catalog
or grepping software with specific roles or traits.
That is what SAs do.

However, non SAs and those that come from fluffy GUI
for everything type POSIX will prefer the menu driven interface
that is provided by Erudite Technic.

Erudite Technic can browse technics for software project by role
and can include or exclude technics that have specific traits.
Erudite Technic is an amusing tool for exploration.
It is useful for configuration.
It is convenient for selecting installed software projects
that should be uninstalled.
