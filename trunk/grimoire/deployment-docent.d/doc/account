The administration account already exists.
The administration account is called root.
While it can be changed
nearly all POSIX use "root" as the administration account name.
And it's UID, user identification, is always 0.

If the system administrator
is also the only user of a computer
then is not having a user account is permissible?
Oddly enough that is exactly what novices expect.
However, any skilled SA will retorts that
the administration account should only be used
for administration tasks and nothing more.

Perhaps all software except firefox
will run if invoked by UID 0.
That does not mean that all software
should be run as UID 0 except firefox.
The firefox software authors merely know
that the root account should not be used
for web browsing because the security risk is significant.

What happens when a user runs
all his software as root, UID 0, instead
of a user account?
Eventually, buggy or malicious software is run.
And it either smites a large portion of the file system
or it grants administration level access
to an unauthorized person.

Consequently, a sane SA maintains security
by using the administration account
only when absolutely required
for performing administration tasks.
Therefore, every user of a computer, including the SA,
possesses a user account.

Please run the useradd program to create a user account
or invoke the more friendly adduser script
which creates the user account
and a user's home directory from /etc/skel/

While the home directory for the root account is typically /root/
The home directory for a user account is typically /home/$USER/
where $USER is the name of the user account.
The reason for that is because /home/
could be a file system other than the root file system.
Therefore, if the SA wants to accomplish a task
that involves only the root file system
then mounting /home/ is not required since the SA
can log in without /home/ mounted and still
be provided with any files stored in /root/
That single exception can seem confusing at first.
But it makes perfect sense when remembering
that the root account is for administration only,
and that the SA has a user account
with the SA's files in the SA's own /home/$USER/ directory.
