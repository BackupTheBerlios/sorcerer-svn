The File System Hierarchy Standard is documentation
that describes the organization of files and directories.
The organization of files might seem less than ideal.
The important aspect is the standardization.
Standardization enables many software authors
to write programs which can be installed
and run on any POSIX that complies with the standard.
Consensus is an important, especially for distributions
that are comprised primarily of free software.

A hierarchy that complies with the FHS
can also be called a real file system.
The qualification of a real file system
is that it should contain directories and files
that are sufficient for running software after booting.
In contrast a rootfs contains only a subset
of the files available on a real file system.
A rootfs should be sufficient for the tasks
of booting and cleanly shutting down or halting.

Complete memorization of file system hierarchy is not required.
However, some concepts possess paramount importance.
/bin/ /sbin/ /usr/bin/ /usr/sbin/
/etc/ /var/log/ /usr/doc/ /usr/share/doc/
The purpose of the directories on the above two lines should
be clearly understood in order to complete this task.

The /aux/ hierarchy is unique to this POSIX.
/aux/ is not described in the FHS.
/aux/ stores generated log files,
temporary source trees,
and downloaded files.
The /aux/ hierarchy is used almost exclusively
by the source administration tools.

The tour docent offers a decent explanation
of directories found within /aux/
While logged in as root
change the present working directory
to any directory within /aux/
to be receive a terse description
of the purpose for the directory.
