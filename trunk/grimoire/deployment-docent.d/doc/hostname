FQDN is the acronym for fully qualified domain name.
A fully qualified domain name could be the domain name
granted by a Domain name registrar.

/aux/set/rootfs/etc/hostname provides the FQDN for the rootfs.
/etc/hostname                provides the FQDN for the real file system.

FQDN must be unique.

If   the hostname for a computer is muffins.eat
then the hostname for /+/base/ could be base.muffins.eat
However, the hostname can entirely differ.

Each     real file system must provide /etc/hostname
/+/base/ real file system must provide /etc/hostname
                      and must provide /aux/set/rootfs/etc/hostname
