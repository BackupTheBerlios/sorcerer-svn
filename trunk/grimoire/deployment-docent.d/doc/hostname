FQDN is the acronym for fully qualified domain name.
A fully qualified domain name could be the domain name
granted by a Domain name registrar.

/aux/set/rootfs/etc/hostname provides the FQDN for the computer.
/etc/hostname                provides the FQDN for the root file system.

FQDN must be unique.

If   the hostname for a computer is muffins.eat
then the hostname for the base root file system could be base.muffins.eat
However, the hostname can entirely differ.

Each     root file system must provide /etc/hostname
/+/base/ root file system must provide /etc/hostname
                      and must provide /aux/set/rootfs/etc/hostname
