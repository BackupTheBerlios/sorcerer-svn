/etc/hosts is nearly as the manual page describes.
However, it has an additional purpose.
It can statically assign
an IPv4 or IPv6 address
to the VETH provided to a root file system.

VETH is a virtual Ethernet adapter.
VETH are created in pairs.
The VETH pairs act as tunnels.

Each root file system is granted one from a pair of VETH.
The other part of a VETH pair remains in the rootfs.
One or more IP addresses can be assigned to the VETH.
Each root file system has it's own unique VETH.
Services that run in the root file system
can bind to ports on the root file system's VETH.
Therefore, a root file system
can have one or more IP addresses assigned to it's VETH.

FQDN is a fully qualified domain name.
rabbit is not a FQDN.
rabbit.hutch.home could be a FQDN.
If the hostname for a computer is hutch.home
then it probably has a root file systems
with FQDN such as main.hutch.home.

If the FQDN specified in /etc/rootname
matches a FQDN specified in /etc/hosts
then the VETH in the root file system
receives the IP address that is specified in /etc/hosts
And the rootfs network stack receives a routing rule
that directs packets destined for the address to the VETH.

If a static IP address assignment is not desired
then at least add a line which reads
127.0.0.1 localhost
Consider it tradition.

If deploying a box with multiple root file systems
then all of the FQDNs for each root file system
can be added to /etc/hosts at this moment.
A requirement does not exist
for each root file system to have a unique /etc/hosts
To the contrary, identical /etc/hosts is a benefit.
Network topology becomes more obvious.
And specifying URLs for connection by name
continues working even when the DNS server is down.
