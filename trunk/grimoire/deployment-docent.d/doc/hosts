/etc/hosts is nearly as the manual page describes.
However, it has an additional purpose.
It can statically assign
an IPv4 or IPv6 address to a VETH.

VETH is a virtual Ethernet adapter.
VETH are created as a pair.
The VETH pairs act as tunnels.

Each real file system is granted one part from a VETH pair.
The other part of a VETH pair remains in the rootfs.
One or more IP addresses can be assigned to the VETH.
Each real file system has it's own unique VETH.
Services bind to ports on the VETH.
Therefore, identicial services such as sshd
can run on multiple file systems and bind to
the default port 22 of the provided VETH.

FQDN is a fully qualified domain name.
rabbit is not a FQDN.
rabbit.hutch.home could be a FQDN.
If the hostname for a computer is hutch.home
then it probably has a file systems
with FQDN such as base.hutch.home.

If the FQDN specified in /etc/hostname
matches a FQDN specified in /etc/hosts
then the VETH in the file system
receives the specified IP address.
And the rootfs network stack receives a routing rule
that directs packets destined for the address to the VETH.

If a static IP address assignment is not desired
then at least add a line which reads
127.0.0.1 localhost
Some programs might malfunction without it.

If deploying with multiple real file systems
then all of the FQDNs can be added to /etc/hosts
/etc/hosts can be granted identicial content
for every instance on a network.
That allows network topology to be obvious
with a glance of /etc/hosts
