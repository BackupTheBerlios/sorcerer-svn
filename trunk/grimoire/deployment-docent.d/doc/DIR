Installed software must update.
Otherwise known vulnerabilities can be exploited.

Software updates cause an inconvenience.
Installed software on a DI, Deployment Image, becomes obsolete.
An obsolete DI may be inadequate
for rescuing a deployed computer
that is unable to boot.

A DI is released once or twice per year.
Software on a DI can become obsolete after an first update.
The solution is to craft a DIR, Deployment Image Repair.

Lore for creating a DIR is the same
as lore acquired during deployment.
Refer to the previous documents and manual
pages as necessary to complete each instruction.

Attach a USB SSD.
The ideal size is 8G.
The minimum size is 2G.

Identify the USB SSD device node name.
The device node name    appears in   /dev/ when the device is attached.
The device node name disappears from /dev/ when the device is detached.

Install a GPT compatible MBR to the USB SSD.
Create one partition.
Grant the BIOS legacy bootable attribute.
Initialize the partition as an ext2 file system.
Give the file system the label "DIR"
Mount the file system.
Copy the content from from /+/base/ to the new file system.
Bind the virtual file systems.
Chroot into the new DIR file system.
Edit /aux/set/rootfs/etc/fstab
Insert above the first line the following line:

LABEL=DIR	/+/DIR	ext2 defaults 0 0

Edit file /etc/hostname
Adjust the hostnames to avoid conflict with other hostnames.
Update the initramfs images
Exit the chroot.
Umount the previously mounted file systems.

The USB SSD is now a suitable DIR.
When glibc updates on /+/base/
then the DIR must also be updated.
It can be re-created, rsynced, or updated
while mounted as a chrooted file system.

Creation of the DIR is optional.
All SAs  create a DIR.
SAs that create a DIR in advance
feel thankful when rescue become required.
Otherwise a DIR is created from a booted computer
to rescue a computer that fails booting.

The creation of a DIR is not unique to this POSIX.
Creating a DIR is a decades old tradition.
Administrators of DOS, Disk Operating System,
created a rescue boot floppy disk.
Since DOS was a simple operating system
the commands to create the boot floppy were simply:

C:> format /s a:
C:> xcopy c:\command a:
