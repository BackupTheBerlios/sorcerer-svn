Sectioning a mass storage device is called partitioning.
Each section is called a partition.
A partition offers a location for creating:
a swap system;
a file system;
a LVM2 physical volume;
a database; etc ...

gdisk, cgdisk, and parted are tools suitable
for partitioning a block device.
Any of the aforementioned tools can be used.
If a preference does not exist
then gdisk is recommended.

Create the 1 gigabyte /boot partition first.
Go to the expert menu.
Go to the attribute menu.
Give the first partition an attribute
that enables legacy BIOS bootable.
Return to the main menu.
Create the additional partitions
appropriate for the selected plan.

Failure to give the boot partition a bootable attribute
results in a deployment that will not boot.
Please verify the partition table.
Write the partition table.
Then exit the tool.

to create legacy partition tables.
Do NOT use fdisk.
Use gdisk.
Using fdisk will create a partition table
that will not boot using boot block
which is installed in the following step.
