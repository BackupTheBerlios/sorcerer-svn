If the role of the deployed computer is workstation
then installing a desktop environment
and web browser could be desired.
kde and gnome are profiles
useful for installing the KDE and Gnome desktop environments.
Although software projects are assigned roles

The catalog of available software contains technics.
Technics are BASH script fragments.
It also contains patch files to apply to source trees.
It also contains and init-scripts.

A shell script is a type of computer program.
BASH is a shell.
A shell is an interpreted computer language.
An interpreter translates human readable source code
to computer code in real time.
Compiled languages translate human readable source code
into computer code during compilation.
And assembly language programs have their mnemonics
translated into computer codes by the assembler
when the programs are assembled.
Assembled programs and compiled programs
can execute faster than interpreted programs
because the overhead for translation happened separately.

Patch files describe how to adjust one or more files.
The purpose of a patch typically fixes a problem
that would prevent compilation, linking,
or installation of a software project.

init-scripts are programs written in BASH script
that perform tasks such as starting and stopping software
during booting, shutdown, and run level change.

Technics invoke Erudite Technic functions.
Erudite Technic functions can perform complicated tasks.
Many tasks that technics require are performed implicitly
rather than begin defined in the technic.
That makes the experience of wielding Erudite Technic;
powerful rather than tedious.

Technics provide a terse yet dynamic method
for describing how software projects
should be downloaded, configured, installed, and run.
One or more technics are typically created for each software project.
In order to install a software project
the technic name must be known or discovered.
Fortunately, the technic names granted to software projects
typically are the same name as the software authors
used for naming the source tarball.

The exception might be profile technics.
A profile technic can requires many other software projects
to be installed.
Therefore, the small amount of effort required by the SA
in order to request a profile technic to be installed
can generate a momentous outcome where hundreds of technics
are cast and hundreds of software projects are installed.

The official software catalog tends to provide
between 3000 and 5000 technics.
It provides technics for highly popular software
that is commonly installed by several POSIX.
A technic name can be grepped from the catalog like so:

# au technics | grep -i kde

The above command outputs many technic names.
The reason for that is because technics typically
are given the same name that the software author
gave to the software tarball that provides the source.
For installing the K Desktop Environment
a profile technic is provided because the software
that comprises KDE is provided by many technics.
Many of those technics should be concurrently installed.
Installing the kde profile removes guesswork
concerning which of the kde type technics should be installed.
Using the profile for installing
can provide the desired software
without wasting space by installing
many of the elective software components
that might not be immediately useful such as
the "Euskara," Basque language, translation files.
 
If firefox and KDE will suffice for now
then the commands to install the software
and watch the progress are:

# au begin firefox kde; au survey

Note that the examples above have au typed
instead of typing the full word aurum.
That is because au is provided as an alias for aurum.
Aurum has more than one alias.
The au and aug aliases are identical to invoking aurum.
However, the "a" alias is special and is described by:

# au help a


If the computer is server
then perhaps server software should be installed?
If it is a web server then installing httpd could be desired.
If so then those commands would be:

# au begin httpd; au survey

The purpose of aurum survey is to see
what will happen, what is happening, and what happened.
The lines at the top are future events.
The lines in the center are current events.
The lines at the bottom are historical events.
And the 4 lines at the bottom provide information about
the state of the queues and the box.

Forcing a reboot or power cycle during software installation
will typically cause the queued states to be retained.
On the next boot the Erudite Technic utilities
will automatically resume where interrupted.
However, compilation of a software project
will not resume where it was interrupted.
Instead that begins again from the beginning.
That helps to ensure that files
were not truncated or corrupted
by the unexpected interruption.

Wane cleans /aux/run/
If the only queue that remains processing is wane's queue
then rebooting is fine.
wane could require some time to complete
If only wane is running
and the other queues are empty
then all the software specified
for installation and removal was processed.
Pressing "q" exits aurum survey.
aurum survey also exists automatically after wane completes.

A SA's general shell utilization skill
determines effectiveness when wielding aurum.
Effectiveness with aurum effects the experience administration.
Those with excellent skills enjoy the experience.
Those lacking skill experience confusion and disinterest.
Reading documentation helps circumvent confusion and disinterest.
Running aurum without parameters provides an overview
of all of aurum's command modules.
Running aurum with

# au help $COMMAND

where command is the name of an aurum command module;
will provide verbose help about that command module
including purpose, syntax, examples, etc...

Most important of all is to make time to read
the BASH manual page.
Or read the manual page of the shell that is preferred.

A wand manifests a wizard's magical intent.
Likewise a shell manifests a SA's administration intent.
Therefore, every SA learns how to use at least one shell.
Otherwise their lore remains
only about as effective as a user.
