      desc 'sorcery-backup creates monthly full backups.

1.  sorcery-backup spell updates monthly.
2.  Backups are stored in /var/cache/backup
3.  Backups include /bin /etc /lib /lib64 /opt /sbin /usr
4.  Backups do not include /var /srv
5.  Backups older than 3 months removed.
6.  An incomplete or failed backup is automatically removed.
7.  SA must restore files from backup manually.
8.  Untaring backup to /lib or /lib64 directories will probably
    cause a glibc break since the glibc libraries will probably
    be in use and the untarred library file will become size 0
9.  Before doing a complete restoration from backup,
    which will lack /var /srv directories,
    boot from an Install/Rescue disk or with rdinit=/bin/bash
    to retain the initramfs as the root filesystem.
    That will avoid the problem described in 8.
10. If disk space permits you may untar the backup to a subdirectory
    and selectively copy files and directories into the root filesystem.
    Again be careful of problem described in 8.'
