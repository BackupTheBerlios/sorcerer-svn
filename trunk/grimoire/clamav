      DESC="clamav is a GPL anti-virus toolkit. 
The main purpose of this software is the integration 
with mail servers (attachment scanning). The package 
provides a flexible and scalable multi-threaded daemon, 
a command line scanner, and a tool for automatic 
updating via Internet. The programs are based on a 
shared library distributed with the Clam AntiVirus 
package, which you can use with your own software. 
Most importantly, the virus database is kept up to date."
