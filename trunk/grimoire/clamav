with info    cite 'anti-virus toolkit
The main purpose of this software is the
integration with mail servers (attachment scanning).
The package provides a flexible and scalable multi-threaded daemon,
a command line scanner, and a tool for automatic updating via Internet.
The programs are based on a shared library distributed with the
Clam AntiVirus package, which you can use with your own software.
Most importantly, the virus database is kept up to date.'
