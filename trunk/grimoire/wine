      DESC="wine runs some Windows 3.x and Windows 9x programs.
wine Is Not an Emulator.
It is an alternative implementation of the Windows 3.x and Win32 APIs.
Wine provides both a development toolkit (Winelib)
for porting legacy Windows sources to Unix and a
program loader, allowing unmodified Windows 3.1/95/NT
binaries to run under Intel Unixes.
Wine does not require Microsoft Windows, as it is a
completely alternative implementation consisting of
100% Microsoft-Free code, but it can optionally use
native system DLLs if they are available."
