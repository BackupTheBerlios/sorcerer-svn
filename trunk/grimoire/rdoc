= RDOC - Ruby Documentation System

This package contains Rdoc and SimpleMarkup.
Rdoc is an application that produces documentation 
for one or more Ruby source files.
We work similarly to JavaDoc, parsing the source, 
and extracting the definition for classes, modules, 
and methods (along with includes and requires).
We associate with these optional documentation contained
in the immediately preceding comment block, and then 
render the resultusing a pluggable output formatter. 
Currently, HTML is the only supported format. 
Markup is a library that converts plain 
text intovarious output formats.
The Markup library is used to interpret the comment blocks 
that Rdoc uses to document methods, classes, and so on.
