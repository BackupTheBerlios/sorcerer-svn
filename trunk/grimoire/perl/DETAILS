cat << EOF
Perl is a high-level, general-purpose programming language.
It is optimized for scanning arbitrary 
text files and system administration.
It has built-in extended regular expression 
matching and replacement, a dataflow mechanism to
improve security with setuid scripts and is 
extendable via modules that can interface to C libraries.
