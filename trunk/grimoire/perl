      desc 'practical extraction and reporting language by Larry Wall
perl is a high-level, general-purpose programming language.
It is optimized for scanning arbitrary
text files and system administration.
It has built-in extended regular expression
matching and replacement, a dataflow mechanism
to improve security with setuid scripts and is
extendable via modules that can interface to C libraries.'
