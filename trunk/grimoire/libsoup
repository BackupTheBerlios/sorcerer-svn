libsoup is a SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol) implementation in C.
It provides an queued asynchronous callback-based mechanism
for sending and servicing SOAP requests,
and a WSDL (Web Service Definition Language)
to C compiler which generates client stubs,
and server skeletons for easily
calling and implementing SOAP methods.'
