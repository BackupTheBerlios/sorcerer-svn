# A cgroup with a sub-cgroup can not be removed.

# for a user's provisioning to remain until reboot.

# Users can make their own sub cgroup
# in order to control some aspects such as
# CPU core affinity.
# However, users may not modify settings
# that of their main user cgroup.
# And user sub cgroups are still bound by the constraints
# of the cgroups that contain it such as the user cgroup.
