      DESC="gle is a graphic library for drawing extruded surfaces.

gle is a library package of C functions that 
draw extruded surfaces, including surfaces of revolution, 
sweeps, tubes, polycones, polycylinders and helicoids.
Generically, the extruded surface is specified 
with a 2D polyline that is extruded along a 3D path.
A local coordinate system allows for additional 
flexibility in the primitives drawn.
Extrusions may be texture mapped in a variety of ways.
The GLE library generates 3D triangle coordinates, 
lighting normal vectors and texture coordinates as output.
GLE uses the GL or OpenGL API's to perform the actual rendering.
