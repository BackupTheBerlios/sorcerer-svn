with info    cite 'graphic library for drawing extruded surfaces

gle is a library package of C functions that
draw extruded surfaces, including surfaces of revolution,
sweeps, tubes, polycones, polycylinders and helicoids.
Generically, the extruded surface is specified
with a 2D polyline that is extruded along a 3D path.
A local coordinate system allows for additional
flexibility in the primitives drawn.
Extrusions may be texture mapped in a variety of ways.
The GLE library generates 3D triangle coordinates,
lighting normal vectors and texture coordinates as output.
GLE uses the GL or OpenGL API to perform the actual rendering.'
