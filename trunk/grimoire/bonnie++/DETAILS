Bonnie++ is based on the Bonnie hard drive benchmark by Tim Bray.
The most notable features that have been added are support for 
>2G of storage and testing operations involving thousands of files 
in a directory.  This program is used by ReiserFS developers, but 
can be useful for anyone who wants to know how fast her hard drive 
or file system is.
