Bonnie++ is based on the Bonnie 
hard drive benchmark by Tim Bray.
The most notable features that 
have been added are support 
for >2G of storage and testing 
operations involving thousands 
of files in a directory.
This program is used by ReiserFS developers, 
but can be useful for anyone who wants to 
know how fast her hard drive or file system is.
