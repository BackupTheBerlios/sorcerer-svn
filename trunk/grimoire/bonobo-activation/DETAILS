bonobo-activation is the replacement for OAF, 
the Object Activation Framework, in gnome2.
It has a similar purpose to gnorba, the GNOME 1.x CORBA 
activation library, and will replace it for GNOME 2.0.
It allows you to do much more powerful activation queries than gnorba.
Each server is described by an XML file that defines its attributes.
When querying or activating, one may specify complex 
requirements using the OAF query language.
