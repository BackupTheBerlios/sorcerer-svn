      DESC="sendfile is a simple asynchronous file transfer program.
Sendfile is a SAFT implementation for UNIX and serves 
as a tool for asynchronous transfer of files through 
the Internet which conserves file attributes.
The sendfile client transfers files to the 
sendfile daemon of the recipient's host.
The sendfiled takes the files, 
stores them in a local spool area, 
and informs the recipient that files have been spooled.
The recipient can then invoke the receive client which 
will copy the files into the local directory, 
deleting the file from the spool area."
