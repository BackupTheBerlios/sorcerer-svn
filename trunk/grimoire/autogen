autogen is a tool designed for generating program files
that contain repetitive text with varied substitutions.
Its goal is to simplify the maintenance of programs
that contain large amounts of repetitious text.
This is especially valuable if there are several
blocks of such text that must be kept synchronized.
Output is specified with a Scheme-enhanced output template.
Input, if required by your template, may come
from AutoGen definitions, CGI data, or XML files.'
