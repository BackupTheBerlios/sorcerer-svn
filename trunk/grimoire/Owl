with info    cite "small security-enhanced Linux distribution for servers

This spell downloads the Openwall Intall/Rescue Live CDs
and stores them in $SOURCE_CACHE/$SPELL/$VERSION

Sorcerer with spell immune-security-tomoyo installed
defends decently against unauthorizied
modification of the file system.
However, for the must have selinux hardened box
Openwall may provide a pre-compiled RPM based distribution solution.

No single tool is best for every task.
Tools such as a screw driver,
which are specialized for driving screws,
tend to produce a more favorable result
as compared to driving a screw with a hammer."
