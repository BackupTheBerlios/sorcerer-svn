      desc 'gsasl is an implementation of the Simple Authentication.
gsasl is an implementation of the Simple Authentication and
Security Layer framework and a few common SASL mechanisms.
SASL is used by network servers such as IMAP and
SMTP to request authentication from clients,
and in clients to authenticate against servers.
The library includes support for the SASL framework
(with authentication functions and application data
privacy and integrity functions) and at least partial
support for the CRAM-MD5, EXTERNAL, GSSAPI, ANONYMOUS,
PLAIN, SECURID, DIGEST-MD5, LOGIN, NTLM, and KERBEROS_V5 mechanisms.'
