with info    cite 'Typeface family (TTF) 
designed to enable the diverse ethnic groups around the world
who use the Latin and Greek scripts to produce readable,
high-quality publications.
It supports a wide range of Latin-based alphabets
and includes glyphs that correspond 
to all the Latin ranges of Unicode.

The full Gentium fonts currently include
only regular and italic faces,
but two new font families - Gentium Basic and Gentium Book Basic - 
give a preview of what a whole range of new weights
will eventually look like.
The Basic fonts only support a limited Latin 
character set (no Greek or Cyrillic).
Gentium Book is a new companion family to Gentium
that is altogether slightly heavier, 
and better suited for some publishing needs.
It supports only the Basic character set at present,
but will eventually match the full Gentium character set.'
