a2ps is an Any to PostScript filter.
Of course it processes plain text files,
but also pretty prints quite a few popular languages (66).
Moreover it has the ability to delegate the processing of some
files to other filters (such as groff, texi2dvi, dvips, gzip etc.),
which allows a uniform treatment (n-up, page selection etc.)
of heterogeneous files.'
