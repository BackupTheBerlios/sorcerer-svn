      DESC="star-dev is a very fast, POSIX-compliant tar archiver.

star is a very fast, POSIX-compliant tar archiver.
It reads and writes POSIX compliant tar archives
as well as non-POSIX GNU tar archives.
Star is the first free POSIX.1-2001 compliant tar implementation.

It saves many files together into a single tape or disk archive,
and can restore individual files from the archive.
It includes command line interfaces for the tar,
Sun-Tar, cpio, pax and gnutar cmdline syntax.

It includes:
a FIFO for speed,
a pattern matcher,
multi-volume support,
the ability to archive sparse files and ACLs,
the ability to archive extended file flags,
automatic archive format detection,
automatic byte order recognition,
automatic archive compression/decompression,
remote archives,
and special features that allow star to
be used for full and incremental backups.

It includes the only known platform independent rmt
server program that hides Linux incompatibilities.
The rmt server from the star package implements all
Sun/GNU/Schily/BSD enhancements and allows any rmt
client from any OS to contact any OS as server."
