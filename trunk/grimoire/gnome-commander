      DESC="gnome-commander is a file manager.

gnome-commander is file manager similar to Midnight Commander 
in text mode, where you work with two directories at
the same time and switch between them with the TAB-key.
This layout is different from most file managers but has 
been proved in a couple of other both free and non free 
programs to be the most efficient way of working with files. 
Besides the basic file-handling functions, the program also 
has basic FTP support.
