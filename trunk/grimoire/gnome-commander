      desc 'file manager
gnome-commander is file manager similar to Midnight Commander
in text mode, where you work with two directories at
the same time and switch between them with the TAB-key.
This layout is different from most file managers but has
been proved in a couple of other both free and non free
programs to be the most efficient way of working with files.
Besides the basic file-handling functions,
the program also has basic FTP support.'
