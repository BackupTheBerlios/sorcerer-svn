Tomoyo on Sorcerer has 3 generally used domain
<kernel> /sbin/init
<kernel> /media/root/domain/limited
<kernel> /media/root/domain/freedom
<kernel> /media/root/domain/sorcery

The first domain is a default domain and provides no restrictions.
The second domain provides restrictions.
The third domain provides no resctrictions.
The fourth domain has restrictions suitable for software compilation,
but not software installation.

Transitioning from
<kernel> /media/root/domain/limited
to 
<kernel> /media/root/domain/freedom
is accomplished by running

# /domain/freedom
or
# /usr/bin/sulogin
or
# sulogin

Transitioning to domain
<kernel> /media/root/domain/freedom
requires authentication with the root password.
Authentication ensures that those who achieve root UID
are rightfully entitled to the privilege of root
rather than having acquired root by exploiting a bug
in a process already running as root
or by exploiting a bug in a SUID 0 executable file.

Those in domain
<kernel> /media/root/domain/limited
will be unable to modify files in
/bin /boot /etc /home /lib /lib64 /opt /usr /var/log/
Mounting also is disabled.
This limits the damage that can be done
when someone acquires UID 0 without authentication.

tomyo can still be configured to provide
mandatory access control lists specific to programs
exactly as described in the tomoyo documentations.
Write the new domain files in /etc/tomoyo/sorcerer/domain/
Write the new exception files in /etc/tomoyo/sorcerer/exception/
That way the modifications are merged with Sorcerer defaults
and loaded into the kernel.

Tomoyo on Sorcerer is not intended to replace traditional security.
Rather the security model is enforced by ensuring that those
who become root can also provide the root password
before gaining privilege to make potentially unwated modifications.

Note that some services will acquire custom domains
that that are far more restrictive than the limited domain.'
