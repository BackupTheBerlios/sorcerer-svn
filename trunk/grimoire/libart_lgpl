It supports a very powerful imaging model, basically
the same as SVG and the Java 2D API.
It includes all PostScript imaging operations,
and adds antialiasing and alpha-transparency.
It is also highly tuned for incremental rendering.
It contains data structures and algorithms suited
to rapid, precise computation of Region of Interest,
and a two-phase rendering pipeline optimized for interactive display.'
