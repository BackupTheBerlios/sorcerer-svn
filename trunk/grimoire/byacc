      DESC="byacc is the berkeley yacc parser.
byacc is Berkeley YACC, written by the
same person who originally did bison.
byacc is smaller, simpler, and faster than bison.
It also generates smaller and faster parsers than bison.
It is the standard yacc distributed with BSD/386
and other Net-2 descendents as well as 4.4BSD.
Needless to say, it contains no AT&T/USL code.
It is completely compatible with AT&T Yacc's documentation,
though it does not neccessarily implement any undocumented
features of AT&T Yacc."
