It mounts the media content of compatible 
UPnP AV devices as a Linux filesystem (using FUSE).
The audio and video content on the network
is automatically discovered, and can be
browsed as a standard directory tree.
djmount should work with any UPnP AV
compliant devices or software servers.
Currently tested devices include
TwonkyVision UPnP Music Server on Linux,
GMediaServer on Linux,
Ahead Nero MediaHome Server,
and Microsoft Windows Media Connect.'
