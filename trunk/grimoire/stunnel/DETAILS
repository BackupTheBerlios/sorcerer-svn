      DESC="stunnel is a SSL tunneling proxy.
stunnel is works as an SSL encryption wrapper between remote
client and local (inetd-startable) or remote server.
It can be used to add SSL functionality to
commonly used inetd daemons like POP2, POP3, and IMAP
servers without any changes in the programs' code.
Stunnel uses OpenSSL or SSLeay libraries for
cryptography, so it supports whatever cryptographic
algorithms you compiled into your library.

See stunnel(8) manual for details.
For UDP forwarding, also look at zebedee."
