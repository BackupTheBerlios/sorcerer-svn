stunnel is works as an SSL encryption wrapper between remote 
client and local (inetd-startable) or remote server.
It can be used to add SSL functionality to 
commonly used inetd daemons like POP2, POP3, and IMAP 
servers without any changes in the programs' code.
Stunnel uses OpenSSL or SSLeay libraries for 
cryptography, so it supports whatever cryptographic 
algorithms you compiled into your library. 

See stunnel(8) manual for details.
For UDP forwarding, also look at zebedee.
