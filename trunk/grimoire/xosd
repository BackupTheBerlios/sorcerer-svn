      DESC="xosd is an on screen display for X.
The difference is it is unmanaged and shaped, so it appears transparent.
This gives the effect of an On Screen Display, like your TV/VCR etc...
The package also includes an xmms plugin,
which automatically displays various interesting
things as they change (song name, volume etc...)"
