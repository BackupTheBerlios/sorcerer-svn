# When updating extlinux's configuration file
# /boot/extlinux/extlinux.conf
# the contents of /etc/extlinux/head and
# /boot/ and /etc/extlinux/tail are combined.
# Please only edit /etc/extlinux/head or /etc/extlinux/tail
# Then execute /etc/init.d/extlinux

# Please set the boot password to something unique
# that is not the same as the root password.
# The password is prompted for when someone attempts
# to enter kernel parameters during boot such as:
# rdinit=/bin/bash to gain a root bash prompt instead of booting
# or just 1 to boot into single user mode.
