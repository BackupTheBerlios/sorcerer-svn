      desc 'calibrates cameras and recovers HDR images
pfscalibration package provides an implementation
of the Robertson et al. 2003 method
for the photometric calibration of cameras
and for the recovery of high dynamic range (HDR) images
from the set of low dynamic range (LDR) exposures.
Tools provided with this software can be used for photometric
calibration of both off-the-shelf digital cameras and HDR cameras
as described in the MPI Research Report.'
