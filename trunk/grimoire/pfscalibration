pfscalibration package provides an implementation of the 
Robertson et al. 2003 method for the photometric calibration 
of cameras and for the recovery of high dynamic range (HDR) 
images from the set of low dynamic range (LDR) exposures.
Tools provided with this software can be used for photometric 
calibration of both off-the-shelf digital cameras and HDR cameras 
as described in the MPI Research Report.
