DirectFB is a thin library that provides 
developers with hardware graphics acceleration, 
input device handling and abstraction, an 
integrated windowing system with support for 
translucent windows and multiple display layers 
on top of the Linux framebuffer device.
It is a complete hardware abstraction layer 
with software fallbacks for every graphics 
operation that is not supported by the 
underlying hardware.
