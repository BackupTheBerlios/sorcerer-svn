      DESC="DirectFB is a graphics library for use on top of the Linux framebuffer device.
DirectFB is a thin library that provides
developers with hardware graphics acceleration,
input device handling and abstraction, an
integrated windowing system with support for
translucent windows and multiple display layers
on top of the Linux framebuffer device.
It is a complete hardware abstraction layer
with software fallbacks for every graphics
operation that is not supported by the
underlying hardware."
