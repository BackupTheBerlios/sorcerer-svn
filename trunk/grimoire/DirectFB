# for photon support which is required for KDE 4.1.0
# Having DirectFB require LibVNCServer creates
# a recursive requirement loop.

DirectFB is a thin library that provides
developers with hardware graphics acceleration,
input device handling and abstraction,
an integrated windowing system with support for
translucent windows and multiple display layers
on top of the Linux framebuffer device.
It is a complete hardware abstraction layer
with software fallbacks for every graphics operation
that is not supported by the underlying hardware.'
