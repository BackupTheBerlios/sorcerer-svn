      desc 'inkscape is a vector graphics editor.
Inkscape capabilities are similar to
Illustrator, Freehand, CorelDraw, or Xara X
using the W3C standard Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) file format.
Supported SVG features include shapes, paths, text, markers, clones,
alpha blending, transforms, gradients, patterns, and grouping.
Inkscape also supports Creative Commons meta-data, node editing,
layers, complex path operations, bitmap tracing, text-on-path,
flowed text, direct XML editing, and more.
It imports formats such as JPEG, PNG, TIFF, and others and
exports PNG as well as multiple vector-based formats.

Inkscape main goal is to create a powerful and convenient
drawing tool fully compliant with XML, SVG, and CSS standards.
We also aim to maintain a thriving user and developer community
by using open, community-oriented development.
