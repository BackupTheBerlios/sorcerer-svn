# The above 3 requirements are for extention dependencies.

# This might be fixable if a legacy version of poppler is installed in /opt/poppler
# and this source can be instructed to use it instead of the /usr installed poppler.
# However, discussion about supporting the current version of poppler
# appears to be ugly and unwilling on the inkscape list.
# Therefore, I also feel unwilling to make an exception to help inkscape compile
# when the software author author refuses to to fix the source.
# Therefore, any problems about inkscape not compiling can be directed as usual
# to the inkscape development list.

Inkscape capabilities are similar to
Illustrator, Freehand, CorelDraw, or Xara X
using the W3C standard Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) file format.
Supported SVG features include shapes, paths, text, markers, clones,
alpha blending, transforms, gradients, patterns, and grouping.
Inkscape also supports Creative Commons meta-data, node editing,
layers, complex path operations, bitmap tracing, text-on-path,
flowed text, direct XML editing, and more.
It imports formats such as JPEG, PNG, TIFF, and others and
exports PNG as well as multiple vector-based formats.

Inkscape main goal is to create a powerful and convenient
drawing tool fully compliant with XML, SVG, and CSS standards.
We also aim to maintain a thriving user and developer community
by using open, community-oriented development.
