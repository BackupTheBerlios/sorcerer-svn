ypbind-mt is a multi-threaded implementation of a NIS binding daemon. 
ypbind-mt compiles and works on Linux with glibx 2.x (libc6).
It should work on every System with POSIX threads and glibc 2.x.
It works under Linux with libc5 and linuxthreads 0.7.1, but this C
library isn't really thread safe and shouldn't be used with threads.
