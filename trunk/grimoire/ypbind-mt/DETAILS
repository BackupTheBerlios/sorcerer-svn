ypbind-mt is a multi-threaded implementation of a NIS binding daemon. 
ypbind-mt compiles and works on Linux with glibx 2.x (libc6). It should 
work on every System with POSIX threads and glibc 2.x. It works under 
Linux with libc5 and linuxthreads 0.7.1, but this C library isn't really 
thread safe and shouldn't be used with threads.
