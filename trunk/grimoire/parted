parted allows you to create, destroy, resize, and copy partitions.
Supported partition types include ext2 and FAT 
(FAT 16 and FAT32) filesystems and Linux swap devices.
Supported disk labels include MD-DOS and PC98 partition tables,
Sun and BSD disk labels, Macintosh partition maps, and raw access.
