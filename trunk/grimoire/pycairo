# Requires Python for running waf.
# Might indicate a problem with the installation of Python3?
# versions that require waf to compile seem unstable
# versions 1.8.10, 1.10.0 that require waf to compile seem
# unsable by pygobject-3.0 when forced to compile with python2
# and cause caribou to fail to compile
# caribou seems to require Python 2 and not Python 3.

# This is filled with #!/usr/bin/env python
# and never runs python3 when /usr/bin/python is installed by Python
# and not Python3
# This will not install unless /usr/bin/python
# invokes python3 instead of python2
