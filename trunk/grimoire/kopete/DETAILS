kopete is a flexible and extendable multiple 
protocol instant messaging system designed as 
a plugin-based system.
All protocols are plugins and allow modular 
installation, configuration, and usage without 
the main application knowing anything about 
the plugin being loaded.
The goal of Kopete is to provide users with a 
standard and easy to use interface between all 
of their instant messaging systems, but at the 
same time also providing developers with the 
ease of writing plugins to support a new protocol.
The core Kopete development team provides a 
handful of plugins that most users can use, 
in addition to templates for new developers 
to use as a base for new plugins.
