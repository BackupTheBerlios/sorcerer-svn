      desc "afio is a cpio-compatible archive/backup program.
afio makes cpio-format archives.
It deals somewhat gracefully with input data corruption,
supports multi-volume archives during interactive operation,
and can make compressed archives that are much safer than
compressed tar or cpio archives.
Afio is best used as an 'archive engine' in a backup script."
