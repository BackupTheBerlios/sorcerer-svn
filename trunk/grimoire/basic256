      desc 'easy to use version of BASIC
designed to teach young children the basics of computer
programming. It uses traditional control structures like gosub,
for/next, and goto, which helps kids easily see how program
flow-control works. It has a built-in graphics mode which lets
them draw pictures on screen in minutes, and a set of detailed,
easy-to-follow tutorials that introduce programming concepts
through fun exercises.'
