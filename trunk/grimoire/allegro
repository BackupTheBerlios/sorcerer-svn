# allegro version 4.2.2 installs /usr/lib/liballeg-4.2.2.so
# but lazily allows ldconfig to create liballeg.so.4.2 -> liballeg-4.2.2.so
# And unfortunately /usr/lib/liballeg-4.2.2.so
# is untracked.
# Therefore, technics that have an ELF requirement on allegro
# probably will not show it in lddof.
# Who knows if /usr/lib/liballeg-4.2.2.so
# when allegro is updated or removed?
# Very sloppy allegro authors!

# 4.9.x is a WIP or dev version.

# uses cmake to compile and therefore is multilib-fail

# Version 5.0.x requires libpng version 1.4.x
