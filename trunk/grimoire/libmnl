with info    cite 'userspace library oriented to netlink developers

This library factors out and provides the many repetitive
and common tasks in parsing, validating, and construction
of both netlink header and TLVs.
Use of this library helps mitigate the production of redundant code
and minimizes the possibility of introducing errors.'
