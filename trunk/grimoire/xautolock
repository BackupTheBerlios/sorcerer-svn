      DESC="xautolock is a x11 screen saver session locker
xautolock monitors console activity under the X window system,
and fires up a program of your choice if nothing happens during
a user configurable period of time.
You can use this to automatically start up a screen locker
in case you tend to forget to do so manually before having
a coffee break."
