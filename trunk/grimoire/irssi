irssi is a modular IRC client that currently has only text 
mode user interface, but 80-90% of the code isn't text mode 
specific, so other UIs could be created pretty easily.
Also, Irssi isn't really even IRC specific anymore, 
there's already a working SILC module available.
Support for other protocols like ICQ could be created.
