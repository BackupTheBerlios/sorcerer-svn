      DESC="irssi is a textmode irc client.
irssi is a modular IRC client that currently has only text
mode user interface, but 80-90% of the code isn't text mode
specific, so other UIs could be created pretty easily.
Also, Irssi isn't really even IRC specific anymore,
there's already a working SILC module available.
Support for other protocols like ICQ could be created."
