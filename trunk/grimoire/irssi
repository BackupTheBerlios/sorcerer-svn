      desc 'text mode irc client
irssi is a modular IRC client that currently has only text
mode user interface, but 80-90% of the code is not text mode
specific, so other UIs could be created pretty easily.
Also, Irssi is not really even IRC specific anymore,
there is already a working SILC module available.
Support for other protocols like ICQ could be created.'
