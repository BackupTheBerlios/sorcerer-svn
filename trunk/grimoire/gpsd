      DESC="gpsd is a daemon that listens to GPS or Loran reciever.

gpsd is a daemon that listens to a GPS or Loran receiver and
translates the positional data into a simplified format that 
can be more easily used by other programs, like chart plotters.
The package comes with a sample client that plots the location
of the currently visble GPS satellites ( if available ) and a
speedometer.  It can also use DGPS/ip.
