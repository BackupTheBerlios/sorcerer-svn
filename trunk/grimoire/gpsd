      desc 'daemon that listens to GPS or Loran reciever
gpsd is a daemon that listens to a GPS or Loran receiver and
translates the positional data into a simplified format that
can be more easily used by other programs, like chart plotters.
The package comes with a sample client that plots the location
of the currently visble GPS satellites, if available, and a speedometer.
It can also use DGPS/ip.'
