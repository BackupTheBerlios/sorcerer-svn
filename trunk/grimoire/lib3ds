      desc 'library for handling Autodesk 3DS files

lib3ds is a free alternative to Autodesk
3DS File Toolkit for handling 3DS files.
The main goal is to simplify the creation
of 3DS import and export filters.
Supported build platforms include UNIX,
Windows with Cygwin, and MS Visual C++ 6.0.
It features support for little and big
endian CPUs, modules for vector, quaternion,
and matrix mathematics, simple data structures
which are easy to manipulate, evaluation of all animation data,
seamless integration with OpenGL,
and the ability to load most 3DS chunks found in the material,
camera, light, mesh, and keyframer sections.'
