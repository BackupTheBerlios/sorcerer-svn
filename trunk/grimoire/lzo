      desc 'lzo is a real-time data compression library.
lzo is a portable lossless data compression
library written in ANSI C.
It offers pretty fast compression
and very fast decompression.
Decompression requires no memory.
In addition there are slower compression
levels achieving a quite competitive
compression ratio while still
decompressing at this very high speed.'
