      desc 'cElementTree Python module provides fast XML processing
The cElementTree module is a C implementation of the ElementTree API,
optimized for fast parsing and low memory use.
On typical documents, cElementTree is 15-20 times
faster than the Python version of ElementTree,
and uses 2-5 times less memory.
On modern hardware, that means that documents in the
50-100 megabyte range can be manipulated in memory,
and that documents in the 0-1 megabyte range load
in zero time (0.0 seconds).
This allows you to drastically simplify
many kinds of XML applications.'
