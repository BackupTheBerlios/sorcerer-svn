      desc 'sflphone is a VoIP phone.
It currently supports the SIP protocol,
G711 codecs, and has some nice features.
It mostly targets businesses, public administrations,
and call centers,
as its goal is to mimic
an enterprise desktop phone
(multiple calls, hold, call switching,
conference, voicemail support, etc.).'
