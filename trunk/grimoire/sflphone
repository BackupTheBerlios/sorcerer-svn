# Requires pjproject, although the library is included in the sflphone.
# pjproject library has already been shown to do damage to a box by
# replacing headers that it does not own, especially:
# glibc owned /usr/include/err.h
# Therefore, I might decide to not support sflphone,
# because it requires a dangerous lbirary.

It currently supports the SIP protocol,

It mostly targets businesses, public administrations,

as its goal is to mimic
an enterprise desktop phone

conference, voicemail support, etc.).'
