# Their instructions in the INSTALL file
# fails to compile and install sflphone.

# Requires pjproject, although the library is included in the sflphone.
# pjproject library has already been shown to do damage to a box by
# replacing headers that it does not own, especially:
# glibc owned /usr/include/err.h
# Therefore, I might decide to not support sflphone,
# because it requires a dangerous library.

# Update source when updating stable
# does not seem to be downloading.

It currently supports the SIP protocol,
G711 codecs, and has some nice features.
It mostly targets businesses, public administrations,
and call centers,
as its goal is to mimic
an enterprise desktop phone
(multiple calls, hold, call switching,
conference, voicemail support, etc.).'
