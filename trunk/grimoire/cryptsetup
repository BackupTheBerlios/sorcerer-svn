      DESC="cryptsetup is a tool for setting up encryption top of the device mapper.
Device-mapper is a new infrastructure in the Linux 2.6 kernel that
provides a generic way to create virtual layers of block devices that
can do different things on top of real block devices like striping,
concatenation, mirroring, snapshotting, etc.
dm-crypt is such a device-mapper target that provides transparent
encryption of block devices using the new Linux 2.6 cryptoapi.
The user can basically specify one of the symmetric ciphers,
a key (of any allowed size), an iv generation mode and then
he can create a new block device in /dev.
Writes to this device will be encrypted and reads decrypted.
You can mount your filesystem on it as usual.
But without the key you can't access your data.
It does basically the same as cryptoloop only that it's
a much cleaner code and better suits the need of a block
device and has a more flexible configuration interface.
The on-disk format is also compatible.
In the future you will be able to specify other
iv generation modes for enhanced security
(you'll have to reencrypt your filesystem though)."
