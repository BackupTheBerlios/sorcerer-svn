To set up an encrypted block device see:

cryptsetup is a tool for setting up encryption top of the device mapper.
Device-mapper is a new infrastructure in the Linux 2.6 kernel that
provides a generic way to create virtual layers of block devices that
can do different things on top of real block devices like striping,
concatenation, mirroring, snapshotting, etc.
dm-crypt is such a device-mapper target that provides transparent
encryption of block devices using the new Linux 2.6 cryptoapi.
The user can specify one of the symmetric ciphers,
a key (of any allowed size), an iv generation mode and then
he can create a new block device in /dev.
Writes to this device will be encrypted and reads decrypted.'
