      DESC="libsigc++ implements a callback system for widget libraries.
libsigc++ implements a full callback system 
for use in widget libraries, abstract 
interfaces, and general programming.
Originally part of the Gtk-- widget set, 
libsigc++ is now a seperate library to 
provide for more general use.
It is the most complete library of its
kind with the ablity to connect an 
abstract callback to a class method, 
function, or function object.
It contains adaptor classes for connection 
of dissimilar callbacks and has an ease of 
use unmatched by other C++ callback libraries."
