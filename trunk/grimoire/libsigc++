      desc 'callback system for widget libraries
libsigc++ implements a full callback system
for use in widget libraries, abstract
interfaces, and general programming.
Originally part of the Gtk-- widget set,
libsigc++ is now a seperate library to
provide for more general use.
It is the most complete library of its
kind with the ablity to connect an
abstract callback to a class method,
function, or function object.
It contains adaptor classes for connection
of dissimilar callbacks and has an ease of
use unmatched by other C++ callback libraries.'
