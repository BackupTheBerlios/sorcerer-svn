      DESC="mcrypt is intended to be a replacement of the old unix crypt(1) under the GPL

mcrypt is a program for encrypting files or streams.
It is intended to be a replacement for the old UNIX crypt.
It uses well-known and well-tested algorithms like DES,
BLOWFISH, TWOFISH, ARCFOUR, CAST-128, and more in several modes (CBC, CFB, etc.).
It also has a compatibility mode with the old UNIX crypt and Solaris DES."
