      DESC="imwheel makes the wheel of your intellimouse and buttons work in X11.

imwheel makes the wheel of your Intellimouse 
(and other wheel and stick mice) work in 
Linux/X11 to scroll windows up and down, 
or send keys to programs.
It runs in the background as a daemon and requires
little reconfiguration of the XWindows setup.
4 or more button mice and Alps Glidepad 'Taps' may also be used.
imwheel includes a modified gpm for an alternate method of wheel input.
