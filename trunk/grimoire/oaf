      desc 'oaf was designed as a replacement for the libgnorba library used in GNOME.
oaf was designed as a replacement for the
limited libgnorba library used in GNOME.
libgnorba is responsible on GNOME 1.0.x and 1.2.x
systems for the activation of CORBA objects.
libgnorba allows you to browse the available
CORBA servers on your system (running or not).
It keeps track of the running servers so that
if you ask for a server which is already
running, you will not start it again but
will reuse the already running one.'
