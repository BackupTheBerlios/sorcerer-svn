      desc 'X11 windows manager similar to NeXTSTEP
AfterStep is a Window Manager for X which
started by emulating the NeXTSTEP look and feel,
but which has been significantly altered
according to the requests of various users.
Many adepts will tell you that NeXTSTEP is
not only the most visually pleasant interface,
but also one of the most functional and intuitive out there.
AfterStep aims to incorporate the advantages of the
NeXTSTEP interface, and add additional useful features.'
