Libunicode offers low-level Unicode 
(UTF-16) text processing functionality.
It uses ISO/IEC 10646-defined UTF-16 encoding for
storing and manipulating all character entities.
It will support other encoding standards
(e.g., UTF-8, ISO 8859-x, etc.) for input and output only.
Libunicode is based, where applicable,
on Single Unix Specification, Version 2(R)
(susv2) as API and semantics reference.'
