with info    cite 'enhanced syslogd
Among other features, it offers support for MySQL and fully
configurable output formats (including large timestamps).
It has been forked from the standard sysklogd package.
The project goal is to provide a more
configurable and reliable syslog deamon.
Reliable in the previous sentence refers to support for reliable
transmission modes like TCP or RFC 3195 (syslog-reliable).'
