e3 - a full-screen text editor written in assembler
e3 is a full-screen, user-friendly text editor with an interface
similar to that of either WordStar, Emacs, Pico, Nedit, or vi.
It's heavily optimized for size and independent
of libc or any other libraries, making it useful
for mini-Linux distributions and rescue disks.
It is also possible to use regular expressions
by using child processes like sed.
e3 has a built in arithmetic calculator."
