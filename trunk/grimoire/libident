      DESC="libident provides a library for interfacing with ident servers.
libident is a small C library for interfacing with RFC 1413
Identification protocol servers, which are used for identifying users.
LibIdent supports both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses transparently.

It is meant to be used by daemons to try to
authenticate users using the Ident protocol.
For this to work, users need to have an Ident server
running on the system from which they are connected."
