      desc 'hc-cron is a modified vixie cron periodic scheduler
hc-cron is a cron daemon for home computers.
It runs specified jobs at periodic intervals and will remember
the time when it was shut down and catch up jobs that have
occurred during down time when it is started again.
Hc-cron is based on the widely used vixie-cron and
uses the same crontab format so that it can be used
as a drop-in replacement for that program.

To have crond start at boot execute:
mkdir -p /var/spool/cron/'

build(){
 sed -i "s/SYS_TIME_H 1/SYS_TIME_H 0/" compat.h
 make            &&
 prepare_install &&
 make    install
}
