      DESC="libmcrypt implements all the algorithms and modes found in mcrypt.

libmcrypt is a library which provides a uniform 
interface to several symmetric encryption algorithms.
It is intended to have a simple interface to access 
encryption algorithms in ofb, cbc, cfb, and ecb modes.
The algorithms it supports are DES, 3DES, RIJNDAEL, Twofish,
IDEA, GOST, CAST-256, ARCFOUR, SERPENT, SAFER+, and more.
The algorithms and modes are also modular so you can add 
and remove them on the fly without recompiling the library.
