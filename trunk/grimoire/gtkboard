      LONG="
gtkboard is a board game architecture and implementation.
It implements all the common aspects of board games, 
such as the user interface, move parsing code, 
AI (i.e., game tree search) and file format.
It has a simple API which makes it very easy to write a new game.
Games are fitted in as plugins.
