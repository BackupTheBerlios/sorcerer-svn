      DESC="sgmltools-lite is the successor of SGMLtools.
It is a set of Python and DSSSL scripts which makes interaction
with Jade in order to process (mostly DocBook) SGML files a breeze,
and is easy to extend with custom processing instructions.
Out of the box, SGMLtools-Lite knows how to convert DocBook 
to HTML (2 styles), JadeTeX, DVI, RTF, PS, PDF, plain text, 
and PalmOS iSilo format.
It also comes with a conversion script to 
convert \"old\" LinuxDoc documents to DocBook."
