      desc 'icecream is a perl script non-interactive stream download utility.

icecream is a non-interactive stream download utility.
It connects to icecast and shoutcast servers and
redirects all fetched content to an stdin-capable player
or to media files on your disk.
With an option turned on, it can save the stream into
different files, each representing the played track.
It is also possible to tee the input to both disk and stdout.'
