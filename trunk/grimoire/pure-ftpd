with info    cite 'an efficient, lightweight, and secure FTP server
pure-ftpd is a fast, production quality,
standards-conformant FTP server based on Troll-FTPd.
It has no known buffer overflows, is trivial to set up,
and is especially designed for modern kernels.
Features include PAM support, IPv6, chroot()ed home directories,
virtual domains, built-in ls, FXP protocol, anti-warez system,
bandwidth throttling, bounded ports for passive downloads,
an LDAP backend, XML output, and more.

The openssl --with-tls option requires the
/etc/ssl/private/pure-ftpd.pem
certificate to be installed.'
