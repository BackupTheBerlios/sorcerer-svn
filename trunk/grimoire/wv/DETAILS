wv (formerly known as MSWordView) is a library that converts
the Microsoft Word 2000, 97, 95 and 6 file formats into HTML, 
which can then be read with a browser.  It also allows other 
programs access to word documents for the purpose of 
converting them to other formats and is currently being used 
by Abiword as its word importer.
