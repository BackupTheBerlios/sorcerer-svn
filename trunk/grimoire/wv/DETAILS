wv (formerly known as MSWordView) is a library that 
converts the Microsoft Word 2000, 97, 95 and 6 file 
formats into HTML, which can then be read with a browser.
It also allows other programs access to word documents 
for the purpose of converting them to other formats and 
is currently being used by Abiword as its word importer.
