      desc 'libbonoboui is a graphical gnome2 document system.
libbonoboui provides UI code for Bonobo,
the Object Activation Framework for GNOME 2.
Bonobo has a similar purpose to gnorba, the GNOME 1.x
CORBA activation library, and will replace it for GNOME 2.0.
It allows you to do much more powerful activation queries than gnorba.
Each server is described by an XML file that defines its attributes.
When querying or activating, you can specify
complex requirements using the OAF query language.'
