jed is a powerful editor with both terminal and X11 interfaces.
Color syntax highlighting is one of its strong suits, 
along with emulation of GNU Emacs, Wordstar, EDT and Brief.
It also supports use of GPM on Linux consoles.
Jed has a multitude of programming modes and couples 
with the Slang library for powerful extensions.
