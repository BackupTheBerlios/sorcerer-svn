      DESC="dcraw decodes raw images from digital cameras
dcraw decodes any raw image from any digital camera.
All digital cameras made since 1997 produce JPEG images
but there are some disadvantages.
JPEG is a lossy format, a lot of information is thrown away.
That's why midrange and high-end digital cameras offer an alternative:
Raw, unprocessed CCD data files, for which the camera manufacturer 
provides special decoding software and there is no source code.
However, dcraw is free and became a standard tool
within and outside the Open Source world.
It is small (about 3000 lines),
portable (standard C libraries only),
free, and when used skillfully,
produces better quality output
than the tools provided by the camera vendor."
