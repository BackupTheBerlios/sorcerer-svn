      DESC="kdar is the KDE disk archiver.
It is a convenient graphical interface to
Denis Corbin's dar archiving and backup C++ library.
You can safely backup (with compression if you like),
view and restore files using KDar,
along with a few easy UNIX commands for mounting
and burning CD-R's, Zip and Jazz drives, DVD-R's,
floppies, or any other disk-based storage media."
