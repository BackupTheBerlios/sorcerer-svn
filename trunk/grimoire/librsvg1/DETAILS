cat << EOF
The librsvg library is a lightweight library for 
parsing and rendering vector-graphic files in 
SVG format (like the ones made by sodipodi).
It also includes functions that render 
anti-aliased fonts using freetype, 
including caching of glyphs.
It's used by Nautilus for drawing 
vector icons and anti-aliased type.
