Lokkit is an attempt to provide firewalling
for the average Linux end user.
Instead of having to configure firewall
rules the Lokkit program asks a small
number of simple questions and writes
a firewall rule set for you.
To make it simple to understand it
is solely designed to handle typical
dialup and cable modem setups.'
