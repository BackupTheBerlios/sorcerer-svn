Lokkit is an attempt to provide firewalling 
for the average Linux end user.
Instead of having to configure firewall 
rules the Lokkit program asks a small 
number of simple questions and writes a 
firewall rule set for you.
To make it simple to understand it is 
solely designed to handle typical 
dialup and cable modem setups.
