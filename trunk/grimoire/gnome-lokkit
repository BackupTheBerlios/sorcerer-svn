      DESC="gnome-lokkit is an attempt to provide firewalling for the average Linux end user.

Lokkit is an attempt to provide firewalling
for the average Linux end user.
Instead of having to configure firewall
rules the Lokkit program asks a small
number of simple questions and writes
a firewall rule set for you.
To make it simple to understand it
is solely designed to handle typical
dialup and cable modem setups."
