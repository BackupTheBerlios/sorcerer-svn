with aim to be complete, correct and easy to use. Currently it
handles many date calculations, date math (addition and
subtraction), and provides convenient methods for retrieving
portions of a date/time.

This module properly supports the Olson time zone database, meaning
that historical time zone information, and more importantly, daylight
saving time rules, can be handled transparently, simply by setting the
correct time zone. This is done by using the DateTime::TimeZone
module.'
