Apcupsd works with most of the APC Smart-UPS models as well
as most simple signalling models such a Back-UPS, and BackUPS-Office.
During a power failure, apcupsd will inform the users about the power 
failure and that a shutdown may occur.
If power is not restored
then a system shutdown follows
when the battery is exhausted,
a timeout (seconds) expires,
or runtime expires based on internal APC calculations
determined by power consumption rates.'
