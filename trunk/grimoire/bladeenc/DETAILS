From http://bladeenc.mp3.no/skeleton/intro.html
BladeEnc is a freeware MP3 encoder.  It is based on the same ISO compression
routines as mpegEnc, so you can expect roughly the same, or better, quality.
The main difference is the appearance and speed.  BladeEnc doesn't have a
nice, user-friendly interface like mpegEnc, but it is more than three times
faster, and it works with several popular front-end graphical user interfaces.
