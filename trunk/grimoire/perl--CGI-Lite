      desc 'perl--CGI-Lite is a perl module to process and decode WWW forms and cookies.
You can use this module to decode form and query information,
including file uploads, as well as cookies in a very simple manner;
you need not concern yourself with the actual details behind the
decoding process.
2.0 unpatched is known to not properly escape dangerous
characters and thus allow an attacker to gain access.'
