      DESC="$SPELL is a simple module to send mail.

Simple platform independent e-mail from your perl script. 
Only requires Perl 5 and a network connection. 

After struggling for some time with various command-line 
mailing programs which never did exactly what I wanted, 
I put together this Perl only solution. 

Mail::Sendmail contains mainly &sendmail, which 
takes a hash with the message to send and sends it.
It is intended to be very easy to setup and use.
