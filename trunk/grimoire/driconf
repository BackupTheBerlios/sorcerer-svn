      desc 'configuration applet for the DRI
driconf is a configuration applet
for the Direct Rendering Infrastructure (DRI).
It allows customizing performance and visual quality settings
of OpenGL drivers on a per-driver,
per-screen and/or per-application level.
The settings are stored in system wide
and per-user XML configuration files,
which are parsed by the OpenGL drivers on startup.'
