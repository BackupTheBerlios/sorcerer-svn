with info    cite 'C library for mulitple-precision computations
MPFR is a C library for multiple-precision floating-point
computations with exact rounding (also called correct rounding).
It is based on the GMP multiple-precision library.
The main goal of MPFR is to provide a library for
multiple-precision floating-point computation which
is both efficient and has a well-defined semantics.
It copies the good ideas from the ANSI/IEEE-754 standard
for double-precision floating-point arithmetic (53-bit mantissa).'
