      DESC="mpfr is a C library for mulitple-precision computations
MPFR is a C library for multiple-precision floating-point 
computations with exact rounding (also called correct 
rounding). It is based on the GMP multiple-precision 
library.
The main goal of MPFR is to provide a library for 
multiple-precision floating-point computation which 
is both efficient and has a well-defined semantics. 
It copies the good ideas from the ANSI/IEEE-754 standard 
for double-precision floating-point arithmetic (53-bit mantissa).
