      desc 'distcc is a C and C++ compiler wrapper to speed compilation.
distcc is a program that distributes compilation of C code across
several machines on a network, resulting in speed increases.
It does not require machines to share a filesystem,
have the same libraries or header files, or superuser privileges,
however both boxes must have the same version of gcc.

Distcc should be run on trusted networks only.
Consequently, this spell is not designed
to invoke distccd automatically
via xinetd or stand alone daemon.
To use ccache and distcc together
export  CCACHE_PREFIX=distcc
as suggested in man ccache
and put that in /etc/sorcery/local.config'
