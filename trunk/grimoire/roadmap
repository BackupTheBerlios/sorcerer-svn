roadmap is a navigation program that displays street maps.
The maps are provided by the US Census Bureau, and thus only cover USA.
A specific area can be displayed by selecting a street address.
It interfaces with gpsd to track a GPS position, and has been
designed to be usable on a desktop, laptop, or PDA computer.'
