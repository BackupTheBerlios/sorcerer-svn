with info    cite 'psiconv is a graphic file conversion utility.
psiconv is a file conversion utility that converts between
Psion 5(MX) files and more commonly-used Linux file formats.
It can read Psion Word, TextEd, Sketch, MBM, and Clipart files,
and outputs HTML 3.2, HTML 4, ASCII, and almost any graphical format.
The libpsiconv library can also read Sheet files and
output Word and TextEd files for use in other programs.
Included is full documentation on several Psion 5(MX) file formats.
This information is not available from Psion
(it has been reverse-engineered from Psion files),
and it is free for anybody to use.'
