      LONG="
iplog is a TCP/IP traffic logger.  Currently, it is capable of logging 
TCP, UDP and ICMP traffic.  Adding support for other protocols
should be relatively easy.  iplog's capabilities include the ability to
detect TCP port scans, TCP null scans, FIN scans, UDP and ICMP "smurf"
attacks, bogus TCP flags (used by scanners to detect the operating
system in use),  TCP SYN scans, TCP "Xmas" scans, ICMP ping floods, UDP
scans, and IP fragment attacks.  iplog is able to run in promiscuous
mode and monitor traffic to all hosts on a network.
