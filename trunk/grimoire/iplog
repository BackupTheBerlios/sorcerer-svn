      desc 'TCP/IP traffic logger that can log a variety of events

iplog is a TCP/IP traffic logger.
Currently, it is capable of logging TCP, UDP and ICMP traffic.
Adding support for other protocols should be relatively easy.
iplog capabilities include the ability to detect TCP port scans,
TCP null scans, FIN scans, UDP and ICMP smurf attacks, bogus TCP flags
(used by scanners to detect the operating system in use),
TCP SYN scans, TCP Xmas scans, ICMP ping floods, UDP scans,
and IP fragment attacks.
iplog is able to run in promiscuous mode and
monitor traffic to all hosts on a network.'
