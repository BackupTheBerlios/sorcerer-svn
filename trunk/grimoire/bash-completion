      desc 'useful scripts for BASH programmable completion

bash-completion provides useful scripts for bash command line completion.
Since v2.04, bash has allowed you to intelligently
program and extend its standard completion behavior
to achieve complex command lines with just a few keystrokes.

Imagine typing ssh [Tab] and being able to complete
on hosts from your ~/.ssh/known_hosts files.

Or typing man 3 str [Tab] and getting a list
of all string handling functions in the UNIX manual.

mount system: [Tab] would complete on all exported
file-systems from the host called system,

while make [Tab] would complete on all targets in Makefile.

This project was conceived to produce programmable
completion routines for the most common Linux/UNIX
commands, reducing the amount of typing sysadmins
and programmers need to do on a daily basis.'
