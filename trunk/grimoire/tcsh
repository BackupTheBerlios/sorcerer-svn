with info    cite 'an advanced C Shell
tcsh is an enhanced but completely compatible
version of the Berkeley UNIX C shell.
It is a command language interpreter usable both as an
interactive login shell and a shell script command processor.
It includes a command line editor, programmable word completion,
command and file name completion, listing, spelling correction,
a history mechanism, job control, and a bunch of small additions
to the csh shell itself.'
