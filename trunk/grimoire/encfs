$SHORT
encfs is an encrypted pass-through filesystem which 
runs in userspace on Linux (using the FUSE kernel module).
Similarly to CFS and other pass-through filesystems, 
all data is encrypted and stored in the underlying filesystem.
Unlike loopback filesystems, this does not 
have any predetermined filesystem size.
