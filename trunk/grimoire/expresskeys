      DESC='expresskeys enables certain keys on recent Wacom tablets
Wacom ExpressKeys supports the fairly recent additions 
of ExpressKeys, Touch Strips, and a Scroll Wheel on 
certain Wacom tablets. Specifically the Cintiq 21UX 
Interactive Pen Display, the Intuos3, and the Graphire4 
tablets are supported through the XInput and XTest 
extensions in X. Using xsetwacom, it can also provide 
an automatic change of stylus pressure sensitivity 
(a.k.a. PressCurve) when going from one program window 
to the next. This feature is independent of the connected 
tablet model. A graphical configuration tool named 
wacom-config can be used to configure linuxwacom and 
expresskeys.'
