Edict can be used to view the meaning of English words. 
It can also provide related details like etymology,

languages is not included, but is easy. Edict can grab 
the meaning of any word from the convenience of the 
command line. You can ask for meanings of multiple words 
at once. You can call edict from within your scripts.
