      DESC='scons is a build tool substitute for make implemented in Python.
SCons configuration files are Python scripts
that call the build engine API.
It can scan files to detect dependencies
automatically and maintain a global view
of all dependencies in a build tree,
and uses MD5 signatures to detect changed file contents reliably.
Timestamps can be used if you prefer.
SCons also supports parallel builds and is easily
extensible through user-defined builder and scanner objects.'

build(){
