      desc 'build tool substitute for make implemented in Python
SCons configuration files are Python scripts
that call the build engine API.
It can scan files to detect dependencies
automatically and maintain a global view
of all dependencies in a build tree,
and uses MD5 signatures to detect changed file contents reliably.
Timestamps can be used if you prefer.
SCons also supports parallel builds and is easily
extensible through user-defined builder and scanner objects.'
