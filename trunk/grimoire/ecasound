      DESC="eacsound is for multitrack audio processing.
It can be used for simple tasks like audio playback, recording,
and format conversions, as well as for multitrack effect processing,
mixing, recording and signal recycling.
It supports a wide range of audio inputs, outputs, and effect algorithms.
Effects and audio objects can be combined in various ways,
and their parameters can be controlled by operator objects
like oscillators and MIDI-CCs.
A versatile console-mode user interface is included in the package."
