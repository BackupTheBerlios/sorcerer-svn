      desc 'gnome-volume-manager is a daemon to enforce volume related policies.
gnome-volume-manager is a desktop-level daemon that enforces
volume-related policy in response to events received from HAL.
Its goal is to implement all functionality as a state-machine
in response to asynchronous events from HAL.

It is one component in a larger plan to fully integrate
all levels of the Linux system, from the kernel on up
through the desktop and its applications.

gnome-volume-manager comes in two parts:

        - gnome-volume-manager:    the manager daemon itself
        - gnome-volume-properties: the control panel applet, for configuration'
