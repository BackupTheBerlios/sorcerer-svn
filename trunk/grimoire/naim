# Therefore, naim can not be downloaded with leech
# unless I rewrite leech.
# Consequently, naim will no longer be supported by Sorcerer.
# They can either get new hosting for the source tarball
# Or have one of those "Google only hires smart people."
# fix their web server so it operates like 99.99%
