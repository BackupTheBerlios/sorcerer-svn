       DESC='jhead is a command line driven Exif header parser and manipulator
Jhead is a command line driven utility for
extracting digital camera settings from the
Exif format files used by many digital cameras.
It handles the various confusing ways these can be expressed,
and displays them as F-stop, shutter speed, etc.
It is also able to reduce the size of digital camera
JPEGs without loss of information, by deleting integral
thumbnails that digital cameras put into the Exif header.
If you need to add Exif support to a program,
this is a simple program to cut and paste from.
Many projects, including PHP, have reused code from this utility.'
