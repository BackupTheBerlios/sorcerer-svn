      desc 'creates wrapper code
swig is a compiler that makes it easy to integrate
C and C++ code with scripting languages including
Perl, Tcl, Python, Guile, Ruby, MzScheme, and Java.
Swig takes a set of ANSI C/C++ declarations
(with optional annotations) and generates an interface
for them to your favorite scripting language.'
