      DESC="swig creates wrapper code.
swig is a compiler that makes it easy to integrate
C and C++ code with scripting languages including
Perl, Tcl, Python, Guile, Ruby, MzScheme, and Java.
Swig takes a set of ANSI C/C++ declarations (with
optional annotations) and generates an interface
for them to your favorite scripting language."
