# From http://ecryptfs.sourceforge.net/ :
# "the stand-alone module code is not as actively maintained
# as the code in the official Linux kernel.
# In general, we recommend that you use eCryptfs that ships
# in the most recent official Linux kernel releases."

# Therefore, use ecryptfs-utils instead of ecryptfs.

      DESC="ecryptfs is a Linux cryptographic filesystem.
ecryptfs stacks on existing filesystems.
It provides functionality similar to that of GnuPG,
only the process of encrypting and decrypting the data
is done transparently from the perspective of the application.

Enable support in the linux kernel configuration to use this."
