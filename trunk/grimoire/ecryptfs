# From http://ecryptfs.sourceforge.net/ :
# "the stand-alone module code is not as actively maintained
# as the code in the official Linux kernel.
# In general, we recommend that you use eCryptfs that ships
# in the most recent official Linux kernel releases."

# Therefore, use ecryptfs-utils instead of ecryptfs.
