      desc 'shell designed for interactive use
zsh is a UNIX command interpreter (shell) which of the
standard shells most resembles the Korn shell (ksh).
It includes enhancements of many types, notably in the
command-line editor, options for customising its behaviour,
filename globbing, features to make C-shell (csh) users
feel more at home and extra features drawn from tcsh.'
