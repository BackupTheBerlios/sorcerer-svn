      desc 'utility to ping multiple hosts at once
fping is a ping-like program which uses the Internet Control Message Protocol
(ICMP) echo request to determine if a target host is responding.
fping differs from ping in a way that you can specify any number
of targets on the command line, or specify a file containing the
lists of targets to ping.
Instead of sending pings to one target until it times out or replies,
fping will send out a ping packet and move on to the next target in a
round-robin fashion.'
