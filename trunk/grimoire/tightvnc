tightvnc is a remote display system for viewing
a computing desktop environment from other boxes.
It is optimized for faster operation on slow
network links such as modem connections,
provides more configuration options in the server,
features automatic SSH tunneling in the Unix vncviewer.
The modified servers and viewers are fully compatible
with the original VNC software.'
