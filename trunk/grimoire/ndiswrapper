Many vendors do not release specifications of the hardware
or provide a Linux driver for their wireless network cards.
This project implements Windows kernel API and NDIS
(Network Driver Interface Specification) API within Linux kernel.
A Windows driver for wireless network card is
then linked to this implementation so that the driver runs natively,
as though it is in Windows, without binary emulation.
 
With ndiswrapper, most miniPCI (builtin), PCI, PCMCIA (Cardbus only)
or USB wireless network cards work in Linux with x86 or x86-64.
Although ndiswrapper is intended for wireless network cards,
other devices are known to work: e.g., ethernet cards,
USB to serial port device, home phone network device etc.

IRC at irc.freenode.net #ndiswrapper 
is not very active, but occasionally
someone there may be able to help you.
