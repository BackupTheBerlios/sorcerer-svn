# Why are my clients unable to connect to the JACK server?
# The most common reason is that the server was started
# using a different user ID.
# Therefore jackd should not be started by an init-script

# recursive requirement on portaudio

with info    cite 'low-latency audio server
It can connect a number of different applications to an audio device,
as well as allowing them to share audio between themselves.
Its clients can run in their own processes (i.e., as normal applications),
or can they can run within the JACK server (as a plugin).
JACK is different from other audio server efforts in that it has been
designed from the ground up to be suitable for professional audio work.
This means that it focuses on two key areas: synchronous execution of
all clients, and low latency operation.'
