      desc 'another implementation of the find utility
It is a fully POSIX.1-2001 compliant implementation of the find utility.
It implements features like -ls and -exec program [argument ...] {} +
(the latter is the POSIX built in xargs).
It has no limitations on path length.
Directory loops caused by hard-linked directories are handled gracefully.'
