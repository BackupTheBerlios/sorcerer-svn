      DESC="vobcopy decrypts and copies .vob files.
vobcopy copies DVD .vob files to harddisk,
decrypting them on the way (thanks to libdvdread)
and merges them into 2 GB files (or larger) with
the name extracted from the DVD.
It checks for enough free space on
the destination drive and compares
the copied size to the size on DVD
(in case something went wrong during the copying)."
