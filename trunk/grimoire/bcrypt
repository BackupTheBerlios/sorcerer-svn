      desc 'blowfish file encryption utility
bcrypt is a blowfish file encryption utility
which aims for cross-platform portability.
In addition to providing 448-bit encryption,
bcrypt overwrites input files with random
garbage before deletion in order to make
low-level data recovery much more difficult.'
