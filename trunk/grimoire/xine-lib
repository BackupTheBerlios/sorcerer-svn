# 1.1.13 gained elective on libmodplug, but why?

# 1.2.0 might not be unstable but it breaks ABI compatibility
# with versions 1.1.x
# Some software might compile error with xine-lib 1.2.x headers.
# Will wait until xine-lib 1.2.1 or later to test the newer ABI

# version 1.2.2 not compatible with phonon-backend-xine version 4.4.4
# version 1.2.3 is missing headers.
# Other POSIX's solution is to include a patch to provide
# the missing headers to the source tree.
# I am not wasting the space in the grimoire for that.
# Reverting to xine-lib to version 1.2.2
