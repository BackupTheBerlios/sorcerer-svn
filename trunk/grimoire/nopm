      DESC="nopm provides a download on demand proxy for /etc /opt /usr

gnome kde and other software
compiled for i586 architecture
exists in a mirror at nopm.silverice.org.

nopm is a client for the nopm server.
It creates an illusion for the user.
When the nopm client is activated
the software available at the nopm server 
appears to be installed on the user's box
even if it is not truly installed.
Files that are only available remotely are downloaded upon demand.
Consequently, the remote programs can be run
just as easily as if they were installed.
However, there may be a small delay
upon initial execution of remote software
while required files are downloaded and cached.

remote files are not installed in /usr.
Downloaded files are cached in ~/.nopm/mirror
Running the nopm client does not require root access.
Running nopm as root is discouraged.
nopm is intended to be run by users
who have neither root access nor a disk quota."
