# Keep the version of linux-headers the same
# as the lowest version supported by the linux-2.6* spells
# but do not back it up to 2.6.27 since 2.6.30 has been running fine.

# Evert reports that 2.6.31.6 works fine with glibc version 2.11.1
# with one exception
# # augur from scsi.h
# linux-headers:/usr/include/scsi/scsi.h
# glibc:/usr/include/scsi/scsi.h
# header overlap.
# And the one from glibc works, but the one from linux-headers does not.
