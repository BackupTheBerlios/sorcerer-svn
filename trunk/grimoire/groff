groff - Document formatting system
Based on a device-independent version of troff, groff
(GNU Troff) is a document processor which reads plain text
and formatting commands, produces formatted output from
them, and then outputs it to another device.

The package is essential for viewing online manual pages.
Output can be produced in a number of formats including
plain ASCII and PostScript.
All the standard macro packages are supported.'
