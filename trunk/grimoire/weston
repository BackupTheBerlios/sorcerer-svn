weston is the reference implementation of a Wayland server.
A Wayland server is a display server,
a window manager, and a compositor all in one.
Weston has several backends as loadable modules:
it can run on Linux KMS (kernel modesetting via DRM);
as an X client; or inside another Wayland server instance.'
