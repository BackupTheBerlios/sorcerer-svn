      desc 'perl module for time zone object base class and factory.
A time zone is represented internally as a set of observances,
each of which describes the offset from GMT for a given time period.
Note that without the DateTime.pm module, this module does not do
much. Its primary interface is through a DateTime object, and most
users will not need to directly use DateTime::TimeZone methods.'
