texinfo - Utilities to work with and produce manuals,
ASCII text, and on-line documentation from a single source file.
Texinfo is a documentation system that uses a single source file
to produce both online information and printed output.
Instead of writing different documents for online presentation
and another for printed work, you need have only one document.
Texinfo can produce output in plain ASCII, HTML, its own
hypertext format called Info, and (using TeX) DVI format.'
