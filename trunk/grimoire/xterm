      DESC="xterm provides a terminal emulator for X.
It provides DEC VT102/VT220 and Tektronix 4014 compatible
terminals for programs that can not use the window system directly.
If the underlying operating system supports terminal resizing
capabilities (for example, the SIGWINCH signal in systems
derived from 4.3bsd), xterm will use the facilities to
notify programs running in the window whenever it is resized."
