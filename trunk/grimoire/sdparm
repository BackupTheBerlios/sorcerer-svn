      desc 'sdparm outputs and modifies SCSI device parameters
When the SCSI device is a disk,
The role of sdparm is similar to its namesake:
the linux hdparm utility which is for
ATA disks that usually have device names starting with hd.
More generally sdparm can be used to output and modify
parameters on any device that uses a SCSI command set.
Apart from SCSI disks, such devices include CD/DVD drives
(irrespective of transport), SCSI and ATAPI tape drives and SCSI enclosures.
A small set of commands associated with starting and stopping the media,
loading and unloading removable media and some other housekeeping functions
can also be sent with this utility.'
