      DESC="sdparm outputs and modifies SCSI device parameters
When the SCSI device is a disk, sdparm's role is similar 
to its namesake: the linux hdparm utility which is for 
ATA disks that usually have device names starting with hd. 
More generally sdparm can be used to output and modify 
parameters on any device that uses a SCSI command set. 
Apart from SCSI disks, such devices include CD/DVD drives 
(irrespective of transport), SCSI and ATAPI tape drives 
and SCSI enclosures. A small set of commands associated 
with starting and stopping the media, loading and unloading 
removable media and some other housekeeping functions can 
also be sent with this utility."
