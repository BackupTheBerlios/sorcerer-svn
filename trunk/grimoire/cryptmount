      desc 'program to allow any user to mount encrypted filesystems
on demand using the device-mapper infrastructure.
Filing systems can be either raw block devices or ordinary files,
with loopback devices setup automatically.

If encrypted devices are to be activated during boot
the password prompt will display only on the tty device
that was specified during # cast -r sysvinit

The default is tty9 for sysinit and tty10 for runlevels 1 2 3 4 5

Although the password prompt may be displayed on a different
virtual console the password must be entered on tty1'
