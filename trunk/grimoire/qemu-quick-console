      desc 'fast virtual console display emulation within qemu

udev normally loads several modules such as cirrus and cirrusfb
while handling cold plug events.
These modules create a huge performance hit,
effectively creating a display bottleneck.
Therefore, this spell installs some black lists
that allow for quick virutal console emulation.
However, for real machine with an actual cirrus graphics adapter;
dispelling qemu-quick-console could be advantageous.'
