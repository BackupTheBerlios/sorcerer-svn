      desc 'trackballs is a game similar to marble madness.
trackballs is a simple game similar
to the classic game Marble Madness.
By steering a marble through a track
filled with vicious hammers,
pools of acid, and other obstacles
the player collects points.
When the ball reaches the destination,
the player continue to the next more
difficult track - unless time runs out first. '
