      DESC='trackballs is a game similar to marble madness.
trackballs is a simple game similar
to the classic game Marble Madness.

filled with vicious hammers,
pools of acid, and other obstacles
the player collects points.
When the ball reaches the destination,
the player continue to the next more
difficult track - unless time runs out first. '
