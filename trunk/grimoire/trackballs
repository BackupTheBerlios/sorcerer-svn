trackballs is a simple game similar 
to the classic game Marble Madness.
By steering a marble through a track 
filled with vicious hammers, 
pools of acid, and other obstacles 
the player collects points.
When the ball reaches the destination, 
the player continue to the next more 
difficult track - unless time runs out first.
