      desc 'cryptofs provides encrypted filesystem support using fuse

cryptofs uses a normal directory to store files encrypted.
The mountpoint contains the decrypted files.
Every file stored in this mountpoint will be written encrypted
(data and filename) to the directory that was mounted.
If you unmount the directory the encrypted data can only be
access by mounting the directory with the correct key again.
Like other LUFS filesystems it does not need root access or
any complicated setup like creating a filesystem on a
encrypted disk using the loop device.'
