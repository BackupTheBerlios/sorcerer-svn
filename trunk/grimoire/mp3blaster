mp3blaster is an interactive text-based program
that plays several audio file types
( MP3, Ogg Vorbis, wav, and sid).
It is one of the few audio players
for the text console that allows
full interactive control during playback.
One of its key features is the ability to
compose a very flexible playlist while playing.
It plays most MP3 formats and has full mixer
support built in.'
