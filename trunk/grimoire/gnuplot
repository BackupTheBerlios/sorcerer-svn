      desc 'mathematical function plotting tool
gnuplot plots 2d and 3d graphs, from a data file or with a formula.
It has an interactive mode with online help, or it can be used
non-interactively. gnuplot does function fitting to data sets,
and it does output to many terminals, among which are PostScript,
X11 display, PNG, and GIF (via the old gd library).'
