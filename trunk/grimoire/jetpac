      DESC="jetpac is an arcade game
Jetpac - The Return is a remake of the original game
Jetpac for the ZX Spectrum and (I believe) the BBC.
The old version was about a space man with a rocket
pack who had to construct his rocket and fill it
with fuel before taking off to reach the next level.
It wasn't quite this simple however because aliens
and asteroids and all sorts of nasties hindered the
space man's mission."
