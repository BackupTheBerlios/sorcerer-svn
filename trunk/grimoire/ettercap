      desc 'network sniffer/interceptor/logger for ethernet LANs
It supports active and passive dissection of many
protocols (even ciphered ones, like SSH and HTTPS).
Data injection in an established connection and filtering
on the fly is also possible, keeping the connection synchronized.
Many sniffing modes were implemented to create
a powerful and complete sniffing suite.
Plugins are supported.
It has the ability to check whether you are in a switched LAN or not,
and to use OS fingerprints (active or passive)
to let you know the geometry of the LAN.'
