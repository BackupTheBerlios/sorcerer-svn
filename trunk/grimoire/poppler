# 0.11.0 links with lcms, but why?
# 0.11.0 failed to install poppler-layer.h
# 0.11.x is the unstable development branch that will become stable as 0.12.x
# The cmake of poppler version 0.12.0 does not install correctly
# and omits the installation of important headers such as poppler-layer.h

# -DENABLE_XPDF_HEADERS:BOOL=TRUE installs unsupported xpdf headers (needed by texlive )
