      desc 'mail retrieval utility
animail is a multiserver POP3/APOP/IMAP4
(with or without SSL) mail retrieval utility.
It features an advanced filtering system based on
blacklisting, whitelisting, or a combination of both.
It is possible to send an autoresponse which prompts people
to reply and add themselves to the autoaccept file.
It also allows filters based on regular expressions
which match against the email headers.
If a message is filtered, only the header
is downloaded, not the entire body.
Combining external filtering programs
(e.g. SpamAssassin or Bogofilter) as message
post-download plugins is also easily acomplished,
thus extending filtering capabilities in an unlimited way.
Available delivery options include mailbox,
maildir, local SMTP, and pipe to a command.'
