      DESC="libofx is a library for Open Financial eXchange specification.
libofx is a generic library to allow financial software to
easily support the Open Financial eXchange specification.
Two utilities are currently included with LibOFX: ofxdump and ofxtoqif.
ofxdump writes to stdout, in human readable form,
everything the library understands about a particular OFX response file.
ofxtoqif is an OFX response to the
QIF (Quicken Interchange Format) file converter.
Much OFX information is lost since the QIF file
format is very primitive, but ofx2qif should allow
importation of bank statements in any software that
support QIF until said software supports the library directly.
LibOFX was implemented from the full OFX 1.6
spec and comes with a developers manual."
