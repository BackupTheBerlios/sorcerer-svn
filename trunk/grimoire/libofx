      LONG="
libofx is a generic library to allow financial software to 
easily support the Open Financial eXchange specification.
Two utilities are currently included with LibOFX: ofxdump and ofxtoqif.
ofxdump writes to stdout, in human readable form, 
everything the library understands about a particular OFX response file.
ofxtoqif is an OFX response to the 
QIF (Quicken Interchange Format) file converter.
Much OFX information is lost since the QIF file 
format is very primitive, but ofx2qif should allow 
importation of bank statements in any software that 
support QIF until said software supports the library directly.
LibOFX was implemented from the full OFX 1.6 
spec and comes with a developers manual.
