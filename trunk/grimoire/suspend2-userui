# if you want a source tarball for it.
# The usplash module is therefore disabled at this moment.

      DESC="suspend2-userui provides userspace user interface to software suspend 2
Having Suspend2-UserUI allows interaction
with the suspend process as it happens.
Pressing escape cancels a suspend.
Pressing R toggles rebooting at the end of suspending.
Verbosity level can be adjusted, etc...
see what's going on, etc.

There currently exists two user interfaces for Software Suspend 2:
* suspend2ui_text - this provides a text-based progress 
  bar, mimicking the original familiar user interface 
  of Software Suspend 2.

* suspend2ui_fbsplash - based on fbsplash (note the 
  fbsplash kernel patch is NOT required), this provides 
  a graphical themeable progress bar. Painting a progress 
  bar whilst suspending to disk actually requires a fair 
  bit of CPU grunt, and isn't recommended for machines 
  slower than about 700-900MHz.
  Otherwise, the speed of suspending is notably reduced."
