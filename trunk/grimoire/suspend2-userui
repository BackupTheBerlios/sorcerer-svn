      DESC="$SPELL provides userspace user interface to software suspend 2
Having Suspend2-UserUI allows you to interact with the 
suspend process as it happens. This mean you can press 
Escape to cancel a suspend, press R to toggle rebooting 
at the end of suspending, change the verbosity level to 
see what's going on, etc.

There currently exists two user interfaces for Software 
Suspend 2:
    * suspend2ui_text - this provides a text-based progress 
      bar, mimicking the original familiar user interface 
      of Software Suspend 2.
    * suspend2ui_fbsplash - based on fbsplash (note the 
      fbsplash kernel patch is NOT required), this provides 
      a graphical themeable progress bar. Painting a progress 
      bar whilst suspending to disk actually requires a fair 
      bit of CPU grunt, and isn't recommended for machines 
      slower than about 700-900MHz. Otherwise, the speed of 
      suspending is notably reduced.
