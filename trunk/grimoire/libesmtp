      desc 'library to manage posting electronic mail using SMTP
libesmpt is a library to manage posting
(or submission of) electronic mail using
SMTP to a preconfigured Mail Transport Agent(MTA) such as Exim.
It may be used as part of a Mail User Agent (MUA)
or another program that must be able to post electronic mail
but where mail functionality is not the primary purpose.
LibESMTP is not intended to be used as part of a program
that implements a Mail Transport Agent.'
