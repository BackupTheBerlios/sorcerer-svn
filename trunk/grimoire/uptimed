      DESC="uptimed record highest uptimes.

uptimed is an uptime record daemon keeping track
of the highest uptimes the system ever had.
Instead of using a pid file to keep sessions apart
from each other, it uses the system boot time.
Uptimed has the ability to inform you of records
and milestones though syslog and e-mail, and comes
with a console front end to parse the records,
which can also easily be used to show your records on your Web page."
