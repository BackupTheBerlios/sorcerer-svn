      desc 'gimp-lqr-plugin is a GIMP plugin called Liquid Rescale
It is a free, open source implementation of the algorithm
described in a paper by Shai Avidan and Ariel Shamir.
It aims at resizing pictures non uniformly while preserving
their features, i.e. avoiding distortion of the important parts.
It supports manual feature selection, and can also be used to
remove portions of the picture in a consistent way.'
