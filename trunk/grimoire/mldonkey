      DESC="mldonkey is a multi-network file sharing client.
mldonkey is a Linux client for the eDonkey network,
built from a reverse-engineered version of the protocol.
Now, it is also able to connect to multiple networks
(gnutella, Direct-Connect, Soulseek, etc).
It runs as a daemon, in the background, that can
run, downloading and sharing files, 24 hours a day.
You can interact with your mldonkey daemon, either locally
or remotely, by a telnet interface, a WEB interface or a GTK GUI.
Other GUIs have also been created for mldonkey."
