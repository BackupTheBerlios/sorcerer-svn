      desc "removes obsolte softare

This performs a weekly check
that probably aught to be performed by
spell immune-exam-clean.
Yet not all SAs want for sorcery tracked software
to be automatically dispelled
when it's spell file is no longer provided?
However, such software is probably obsolete
and probably should be removed.

immune-exam-dispel should be unable
to accidentally mass dispel
the entire installed content of a box.
The \"augur gone\" command
aborts rather than providing an answer
when the amount of available spells seems execessively low.
Consequently, having this spell installed
should not become an invitation for a box to self destruct."
