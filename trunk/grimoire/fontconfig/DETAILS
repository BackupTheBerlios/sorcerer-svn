Fontconfig can:

* discover new fonts when installed automatically, 
  removing a common source of configuration problems.
* perform font name substitution, so that appropriate 
  alternative fonts can be selected if fonts are missing.
* identify the set of fonts required to completely cover 
  a set of languages.
* have GUI configuration tools built as it uses an 
  XML-based configuration file (though with autodiscovery, 
  we believe this need is minimized).
* efficiently and quickly find the fonts you need among 
  the set of fonts you have installed, even if you have 
  installed thousands of fonts, while minimzing memory usage.
* be used in concert with the X Render Extension and FreeType
  to implement high quality, anti-aliased and subpixel rendered 
  text on a display.

Fontconfig does not:

* render the fonts themselves 
  (this is left to FreeType or other rendering mechanisms)
* depend on the X Window System in any fashion, so that 
  printer only applications do not have such dependencies.
