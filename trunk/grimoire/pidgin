 # pidgin requires the rpath for dynamically loading plugins
 # however the pidgin source compiles without automatically adding rpath
 # and that is odd since it makes certain protocols unavailable
 # such as google talk XMPP jabber protocol.
 # XMPP, google talk, and jabber are all the same protocol.
 # Adding the rpath below fixes that.
 # This fix is not expected to be specific to a precise version of pidgin.
