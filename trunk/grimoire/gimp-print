      DESC="gimp-print is a collection of very high quality printer drivers.
The goal of this project is uncompromising 
print quality and robustness.
Included with this package is the Print
plugin for the GIMP (hence the name), 
a CUPS driver, and a driver for Ghostscript 
that may be compiled into that package.
This driver package is Foomatic-compatible 
to enable plug and play with many print spoolers.
In addition, various printer maintenance 
utilities are included."
