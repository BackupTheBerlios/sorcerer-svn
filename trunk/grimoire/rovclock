ATI graphics cards, at least the R350, seem to melt down.
They work okay for a while, but then they start
to overheat and eventually completely fail.
However, from lowering the clock speed and memory speed
it appears to be possibiel to improve FPS
and maybe it will keep the card from overheating and self destructing.'
