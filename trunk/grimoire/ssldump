      LONG="
ssldump is an SSLv3/TLS network protocol analyzer. 
It identifies TCP connections on the chosen network 
interface and attempts to interpret them as SSLv3/TLS 
traffic. 
When it identifies SSLv3/TLS traffic, it decodes the 
records and displays them in a textual form to the 
console. If provided with the appropriate keying 
material, it will also decrypt the connections and 
display the application data traffic.
