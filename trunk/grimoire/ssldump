      desc 'ssldump is an SSLv3/TLS network protocol analyzer.
It identifies TCP connections on the chosen network
interface and attempts to interpret them as SSLv3/TLS traffic. 
When it identifies SSLv3/TLS traffic, it decodes the
records and displays them in a textual form to the
console. If provided with the appropriate keying
material, it will also decrypt the connections
and display the application data traffic.'
