      DESC="courier-authlib provides the courier authnetication library.
The Courier Authentication Library is a generic authentication API
that encapsulates the process of validating account passwords.
In addition to reading the traditional account passwords from
/etc/passwd, the account information can alternatively be
obtained from an LDAP, MySQL, PostgreSQL, GDBM or a DB file.
The Courier authentication library must be installed before building
any Courier  packages that needs direct access to mailboxes (in other
words, all packages except for courier-sox and courier-analog)."
