      desc 'complete rewrite of the NASM assembler
yasm is a complete rewrite of the NASM assembler.
It is designed from the ground up to allow for
multiple syntaxes to be supported (e.g., NASM, TASM, GAS, etc.)
in addition to multiple output object formats.
Another primary module of the overall design is an optimizer module.'
