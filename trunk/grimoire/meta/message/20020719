Subject:  Any Linux-PAM enabled boxes get stranded?

This is the 2nd message of the sorcery messaging system.
If you missed the first you can read it by typing
less /var/log/sorcery/message/20020718

This is to report that the upgrade of Linux-PAM 
might cause problems for sshing into some boxes.
pam_limits.so in the /etc/pam.d/sshd appears to be causing 

[sshd] fatal: PAM session setup failed[6]: Permission denied

which results in one not being able to ssh into a box
inspite of providing the correct password.  Therefore,
that line is being removed from all /etc/pam.d/sshd files.

If you know more about what is going on.  Please email me.
