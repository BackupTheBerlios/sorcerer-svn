Subject:  Concurrent Branches

The way branches used to work was that you 
could have any single branch of a spell 
installed at a given time.  However you
could not have multiple branches of the
same spell installed concurrently.
Now you can.

Spells with branches will show up in the
sorcery menus like:

gtk+
gtk+,v1.2

Those two branches of the same spell can 
be concurrently installed.

However certain reserved branch names are assumed
not to be concurrently installed with the default
branch of the spell.  For example:

fcron
fcron,ai
fcron,delay
fcron,dev
fcron,test

only one branch will be installed at a time.

Hopefully this added flexibility will increase
functionality and decrease ambiguity.
