Sorcerer News for 20030409

Subject:  Down with cruft, up with functionality.

About 15% of the the compressed sorcery tarball 
saw very little use if ever and was probably
overly complicated.  I am writing about the
pack of menus for selecting which gcc to use
and what parameters to pass to it at compile time.

Some SAs may miss those nice selection menus of 
gcc command line parameters to choose from.
However most of us choose our gcc parameters 
from the gcc info and man pages or documentation.
One fault of the selection menus was that they
gave no information about what those parameters do.
Therefore, they were probably more of a bane 
of confusion to the novice SA than a boon.

Some SAs have mentioned that they prefer to 
compile software with different optimizations.
Some prefer safe optimizations on core spells,
while for some spells they prefer aggressive
unsafe optimizations.  It was possible to
do this previously, although not obvious to everyone.

We are switching to a simpler easy to edit set 
of files in the directory of /etc/sorcery/cpref 
that export variables such as CFLAGS, CXXFLAGS, LDFLAGS, 
and PATH which describe how to compile and what compiler to use.
There will be no limit to the amount of 
preference files that can be created.
Any spell or spells can use a preference file.

Most of us will copy fast to custom, add something
like -march=athlon-tbird to the CFLAGS and CXXFLAGS
symbolic link custom to default and be set to go.

The addendum will attempt to give you a default set
of cpref files along with a custom cpref as a default 
built in the same fashion that optimizations were previously.
