Sorcerer News for 20030811

Subject:  News for this month.

How do you like sorcery-Ti, sorcery Titanium
the surprisingly strong yet light weight SA tool?
Yes it seems stable enough and fast also, 
therefore from this point forward mostly
only bug fixes will be applied.

Eager to try gcc 3.3 or 3.3.1?  It still has bugs.
Some of the problems that arise from using gcc 3.3.1
are circumventable such as rewriting multi-line string literals.  
Of course just about every spell in every grimoire would have
to be recompiled to determine which sources need to be fixed.
Other bugs are not so easily circumvented.
That is why gcc in the grimoire remains at 3.2.3

Also if/when you do upgrade to gcc 3.3.1 
everything in ccache cache become useless.
Saved previously compiled object files can not 
be reused when the compiler versions are different.
For the time being we should all feel very 
comfortable about staying with gcc 3.2.3

Did cast ask if a grimoire should 
be untared on a recent upgrade?
The grimoires in /var/lib/sorcery/grimoire.library/
can remain as directories or be processed as
uncompressed tar files.
Accessing an entire grimoire as a single uncompressed 
tar files is much faster than digging through a mess
of directories and files.  There are no adverse effects.

If you are fishing for example spells take them from
the merged grimoire at /var/state/sorcery/grimoire.
The merged grimoire remains as 
a mess of directories and files.
Potential slowness in accessing it are mitigated 
by it's index and because both are on tmpfs.
