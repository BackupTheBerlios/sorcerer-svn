Subject:  Time to Hunt Bugs and play with wizard.x

Sorcery development from here forward is fluff.
All the important features and functionality are in.
Now is a good time to hunt bugs so 
sorcerer can go stable next month.

Please report bugs you encounter,
their error messages,
what you typed to cause them,
whether they are repeatable,
and any other useful information 
pertaining to the bug.

And now for the fluff.
As you have already noticed foreman has become wizard.
Plenty of SAs mentioned that foreman did not fit the theme.
So foreman was changed to wizard, not that it makes any sense.

The display of wizard output has changed.
Some SAs have mentioned they prefer the
previous columnized display over the the 
newer more screen-estate economical display.
Consequently, I am compromising to add another 
possible attractive method for viewing 
wizard's information.

In order to use the newer method of display
you must be running XFree86, have xterm installed,
symbolic link /root/.Xauthority to your logged in 
user's ~/.Xauthority, have 
export  DISPLAY=0:0 when su - to root,
and have WIZARD="wizard.x" in /etc/sorcery/local.config

This can be accomplished by:

$ whoami  # Remember what it said.
$ su -
# ln -sf /home/whoyouare/.Xauthority  /root/.Xauthority
# echo  "export  DISPLAY=0:0"  >>     /root/.bash_profile
# echo  "WIZARD=wizard.x"      >>     /etc/sorcery/local.config


Now when the wizard is started it will output 
information in several nicely cropped xterm boxes.
If you want the wizard running all the time
even when not required which doesn't require much
CPU you can invoke it as 
wizard --stay
or
wizard.x --stay

If you don't care to look at a particular information
xterm box that wizard.x opens simply slam it shut.
This will not effect wizard.x's ability to function.
However if you ctrl-c or slam shut the terminal window
used to invoke wizard.x, then wizard.x is gone, history.

After a series of casts complete and wizard and/or wizard.x
was not invoked with the --stay command, the information 
boxes will close within a minute.

If you want to start a new wizard in another 
terminal window do not terminating the first.
Issue a wizard  --restart in the new terminal 
and it will start and the old wizard will end.
