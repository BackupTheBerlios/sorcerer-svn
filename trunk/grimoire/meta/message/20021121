Subject:  Tighter organizational structure for spooled sources.

\$SOURCE_CACHE, which is normally "/var/spool/sorcery"
now contains directories such as:

TRASH
\$SPELL/\$VERSION

The more organized directory structure will enable better 
removal of old sources.  When a version of a source 
becomes pruned it will be moved to /var/spool/sorcery/TRASH
At any time you need extra disk space you can
rm  -rf  /var/spool/sorcery/TRASH

PRUNE is still adjustable as usual.
Ordinarily a default PRUNE of 4 means that
a source 4 versions old will be trashed
on a successful upgrade/download of a 
current version of the source.

At this moment there is no automatic trash collection.
You can set a cronjob with a find command to delete
trash for example, or just let it accumulate.
If you keep the trash, leech will dig threw it before 
downloading new sources, just in case it finds what it 
requires.

The tighter organization is an effort to make sorcery
function fast, consistently 100% of the time, and efficiently.
Other sorcery directories will become more organized as well, 
such as /var/cache/sorcery.  Check augur in the near future 
for useful trash removal commands.
