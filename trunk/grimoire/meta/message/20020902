Subject:  Use logs are now available.

If you cast installwatch, which I enhanced, sorcery 
will begin to create use logs in /var/log/sorcery/use
Use logs display spells that had files which 
were used during the cast of another spell.

It is similar to augur ldepends_of.
ldepends_of does not show spells with libraries 
that were statically linked with the spell in question.
However, use logs will show those spells which were 
used, no matter whether their installed libraries are 
statically or dynamically linked.

Cast now executes a single retry of compilations which
fail due to a Segmentation fault.  Anyone else have 
reports of a common random error, which should be 
compensated for?
