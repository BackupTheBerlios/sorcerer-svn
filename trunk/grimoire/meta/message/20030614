Sorcerer News for 20030614

Subject:  You survived Friday the 13th.
          Can you survive these changes?

This news bulletin is of interest to 
Sorcerer SAs and grimoire gurus who 
know what excluded and protected files 
and directories are and use them.

meta/protected and
meta/excluded  are depreciated
which means they are no longer used.
For a little while longer they will be used,
but instead you should put protected and 
excluded information into spell directories 
for the spell with which they belong.
The reason for this change is because 
with multiple grimoires installed
there can not be multiple 
meta/protected and 
meta/excluded  files.
They would overwrite each other on the merge.

LOCAL_EXCLUDED and LOCAL_PROTECTED are no longer used.
On local spells please add the files and/or directories
that you want protected and/or excluded into the 
plain text files protected and/or excluded, respectively,
with one entry per line.
Please place your local spells in:
/var/lib/sorcery/grimoire.library/local

For those of you who have forgotten what protected
and excluded files and/or directories are...

Excluded files and directories are not 
tracked when a spell is installed.
Protected files and directories are not 
reaped when an installed spell is dispelled.
Since files and directories which are excluded 
are not tracked they naturally can not be reaped.
However the converse is not true.
