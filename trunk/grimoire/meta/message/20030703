Sorcerer News for 20030703

Subject:  1. /tmp/sorcery is no longer used.  *Important Must Read*
             and neither is /dev/shm/sorcery


Maybe /dev/shm isn't a good place for 
sorcery's interprocess shared data files?
/tmp/sorcery will no longer be on /tmp/sorcery
nor will it be on /dev/shm/sorcery.
The generated data will now be kept on /var/state/sorcery.

Please

mkdir  -p  /var/state/sorcery

Next edit /etc/fstab and add the line

tmpfs	/var/state/sorcery tmpfs	defaults,size=256M,nr_inodes=128k 0 0

and finally

mount  /var/state/sorcery

That will keep sorcery running at the lightening 
fast speed that you are accustomed to.

Those SAs who reboot frequently and
would rather etch a groove into their disk 
than merge grimoires and regenerate the index,
simply do not mount tmpfs onto /var/state/sorcery.
