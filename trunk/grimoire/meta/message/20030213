Subject:  Goodbye sedit, hello foreman.

Someone told me that sed version 4.x has 
the -i parameter to edit in place a file.  
Therefore, the function sedit, which was 
from the days of sed 3.x which did not 
have the -i parameter, is no longer needed.
Please modify local spells replacing 
"sedit" with "sed  -i"

The previous method for cast's locking
was for every spell to figure out when
it should compile and when it should wait.
The previous method wastes CPU cycles.
The new implementation is more reliable,
flexible and efficient.

The new method is for a single process 
to determine what and when spell compile.
The name of this process, which is not 
a typical cast process, is foreman.
A single foreman process directs all casts
whether started by the same or separate commands.

Foreman is available on attached terminals,
but not on casts started from at and cron jobs
such as nightly or weekly automatic updates.  
Casts without foreman proceed in the proper 
order sequentially, or one compile at a time.
If you experience problems doing updates from
cron-jobs, please email me as much information
as possible about it so that we can identify
and circumvent the problem.
