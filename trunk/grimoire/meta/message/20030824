Sorcerer News for 20030824

Subject:  Switching to sentinel or strace.

Choosing between the quirkiness of stracing 
only what comes after a prepare_install or
stracing the entire cast at a 5% performance 
decrease almost seems like a lose/lose scenario?
That is why I spent half of yesterday looking at
/usr/share/man/man3/dlopen.3
Afterward, I wrote an excellent program 
for hijacking system library calls.
I call it sentinel.

Sentinel is not based upon installwatch.
It is faster than installwatch.
It outputs less than installwatch.
It does not segmentation fault like installwatch.
Therefore, LD_PRELOAD does not have to 
be unset within certain BUILD files.
Casting is now as smooth as it should be.

Sentinel is included in the sorcery tarball.
Architectures that are not i586 or i686 
will use full straces instead of sentinel.
