Subject:  Goodbye wget, hello curl.

Server quality detection has been removed.
It could not indicate the speed at which 
servers can transfer files.

As a benefit to boxes with a high speed 
Internet connections the transfer client 
in leech has been switched from wget to curl.
Unlike wget, curl can drop connections to 
servers that are transferring files too slowly.
Naturally, you will read "man curl"
to learn how to enable it's useful options.
Put these parameters into either:

/root/.curlrc
/root/.curlrc.sorcery


Download server order preference can be set using augur.

from the augur help screen.

prefer          server  value   Specify an download order preference for a
                                server giving a value between 0 and 32767
                                0       =       always first
                                32767   =       always last

Examples:

If the known fastest connection from 
your box to a source forge server is 
easynews.dl.sourceforge.net

Then, issue:

# augur prefer easynews.dl.sourceforge.net 0

Now it will be tried first when it is in a URL list.


And if you prefer telia.dl.sourceforge.net as the second server
then issue:

# augur prefer telia.dl.sourceforge.net 1


If you prefer unc.dl.sourceforge.net to be the last server tried
then issue:

# augur prefer unc.dl.sourceforge.net 32767


There is now an official sorcerer mirror site.
If you find that the main site is intolerably 
slow the request that it be tried last

# augur prefer sorcerer.wox.org 32767


3 fat servers would be a good number of official mirrors.
Too few servers and the load would be difficult to distribute.
Too many servers and the time to locate a new source
file or xdelta upgrade patch would be lengthy.
If you want to become an official sorcerer mirror
please email the sorcerer-spells list.


Unregulated mirrors will not be 
recognized or supported by sorcery.
Unofficial and/or private mirrors 
need not be reported as long as 
they are not violating 
Sorcerer Public License.
Creating a private mirror to support 
your work LAN is strongly encouraged.


augur can report the size of source files 
both before or after downloading them.

Example:

# augur size uqm,voice
http://unc.dl.sourceforge.net/sourceforge/sc2/uqm-0.2-voice.zip 113699708

Only a 12 hour download with a 28.8 modem.
