No there isn't really a dev branch of sorcery and a stable branch.
This gives you an opportunity to update sorcery 
at your convenience and not loose settings and customization.
sorcery,dev will go away around 20021014
Before that happens, do # cast sorcery,dev
After it finishes, enter into sorcery's option menu.
Visit every menu, in the option menu and sub-menus,
and select settings.

When the sorcery,dev branch goes away your box(s)
will automatically rejoin the sorcery default branch.
Hope you enjoy the changes.  Info gcc will explain 
what all those parameters do.
