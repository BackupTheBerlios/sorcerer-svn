Subject:  Say hello to AI-Guru

Maintaining a distribution's software catalog 
requires much time and effort.  I hoped the 
Grimoire Gurus would maintain and update 
the software catalog, however the reality 
is that I do.  Therefore, I programmed the 
help I require.

Since this will be the first auto-magically 
maintained distribution, Sorcerer will 
remain beta for a time longer to find and fix 
the problems that occur from having a programmed 
intelligence at the helm.

By having AI-Guru maintain the grimoire I will have
more time to get the bugs out of sorcery and create
the tool for system administration that I have 
envisioned as sorcery.  Also as AI-Guru improves 
the result will be a better maintained grimoire, 
software catalog, with less breakage and fewer 
errors that result from human error, assumptions, 
and/or lack of time.
