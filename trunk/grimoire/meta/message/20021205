Subject:  If    you use Linux 2.4.20    &&
                have ext3 file systems  &&
                have them mounted with data=journal
          then  this news is for you.

First, please read:

There's a bug in the kernel.
Fortunately, it doesn't affect most people.

The easy way to avoid the bug is to let a file system 
be idle for 1 minute before unmounting it, 
and let all file systems be idle for 
1 minute before issuing a reboot command.

Until this has past you may want to edit 
/etc/fstab and make certain that there are no 
data=journal in it for ext3 file systems so you 
will not have to repeat the waiting 1 minute 
before unmounting procedure continually.
