Sorcerer News for 20031110

Subject:  Upgrades!

Subtitle:  Are you ready for gcc 3.3.2?

Sorcerer boxes are upgrading from gcc 3.2.3 to gcc 3.3.2.
Consequently, you could encounter sources that will 
not compile with gcc 3.3.2 without some adjustments.
If you encounter a spell in the grimoire that
fails to re-compiled because of the gcc upgrade 
please report it so that we can write a patch.

If you are pleased with gcc 3.2.3, as we have been for months, 
feel free to "sold," secure hold, gcc until January 2004.
Forward compatibility problems are unlikely until next year.
And previously saved cached object files will
retain their usefulness until gcc is upgraded.

The reasons we delay upgrading gcc is to wait 
long enough for most stable releases of maintained 
software to catch up with the gcc changes,
and for the gcc 3.3 branch to be heavily bug fixed.
The proper functioning of the compiler in a source
based distribution is of paramount importance.
We upgrade gcc slowly in order to avoid bugs 
and changes that could cause breakage and/or ripples
of instability within the distribution.


Subtitle:  Is netkit-combo dead?  Use inetutils instead.

Bug fixes for netkit-combo now come entirely from distributions.
No one appears to be externally maintaining the source.
It has some security issues and compilation problems.
That is why netkit-combo is leaving the grimoire.

About a year ago I was evaluating inetutils,
a substitute for netkit-combo, for use with sorcerer.
Unfortunately, I stumbled across errors in ping
and other programs and decided it would be best 
to stay with netkit-combo until a more polished
release of inetutils became available.
Now we are proceeding with the switch.

Sorcerer is switching to inetutils to provide programs such as:
  Clients: ftp ping rpc rlogin rsh talk telnet tftp
  Servers: ftpd inetd rexecd rlogind rshd talkd telnetd tftpd uucpd

If you use any of the above utilities then on effected boxes
# cast inetutils
is recommended.
If none of the above programs are desired then 
# dispel --unsafe --nosustain netkit-combo
is recommended.

There are 2 major differences between 
the netkit-combo and inetutils spells.
Unlike netkit-combo inetutils offers a choice 
to compile and install for each client and server.
That barrage of 16 questions is the main reason 
not having this upgrade/transition happen automatically.

Unlike netkit-combo inetutils will not install xinetd
configuration files to invoke servers automatically.
Most of those servers are not wanted on modern boxes.
Many of the services have far superior 
servers available by other spells.
If a SA does want a server from inetutils 
then the SA will probably run it from within a 
chrooted or caged filesystem to limit access.
That is why they are not invoked by xinetd.

The recommend programs to install when 
casting inetutils are: ftp, ping, telnet, tftp


Subtitle:  Is the sorcerer website dead?

Although we are adding and upgrading documentation,
there is often little new to see at the sorcerer
website, because it changes the least of all.
However in November expect to see a some nice
improvements in functionality and appearance by
the combined efforts of Jan Merka and xScruffx.
I am impressed with what they have shown so far.
Hopefully you will be impressed with the final revision.
Thanks fellows.

Thank you for reading the Sorcerer news.
