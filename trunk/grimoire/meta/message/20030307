Sorcerer News for 20030307

Subject:  Safe Hold

Now you can run boxes in a method similar 
to the point releases of binary based distros.
Sorcery has a new capability called sold.
Sold or safe hold operates identical to hold except 
that only safe versions of software are held.

The following is an example of how safe hold works.

The installed version of snort is 1.9.0 and on safe hold.
Version 1.9.1 becomes available and is on the safe list, 
but the installed version 1.9.0 is not.
Consequently the installed snort will be upgraded.

A while later snort version  1.9.2 becomes available.
Unlike version 1.9.1 version 1.9.2 is not a security update.
Therefore, both versions 1.9.2 and 1.9.1 are on the safe list.
Consequently the installed snort is not upgraded.

Sold is not a replacement for hold, nor does it replace hold.
Installed spells need not be both hold and sold.
If an installed spells is both sold and hold it will be
upgraded according to the above rules for spells on safe hold.

Sold is a new capability and is not retroactive-active.
From 20030307 forward the spells in the official grimoire 
will begin to acquire the SAFE array variable to describe 
the versions that have no published security vulnerabilities.

Sold will extended back typically to 10 versions.
If you have ancient software installed and no desire 
to update it then place it on hold instead of sold.
