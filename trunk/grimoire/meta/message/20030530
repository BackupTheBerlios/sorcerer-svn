Subject:  Grimoires

Did you noticed on the previous update all
the game spells vanished from the grimoire?
They moved to game-grimoire, which can be 
installed either from the spell menu in 
sorcery or with a simple cast game-grimoire.

The reason for the game grimoire is simple.
Production boxes do not require games.
By not having games in their grimoire
they will update faster, transfer less bytes,
index faster, merge faster, and use less space 
in memory + swap when stored on /tmp/sorcery

Additionally, after we are satisfied that the
game grimoire is working okay we will change
it's update cycle to weekly.  That way when
updating boxes with the game grimoire installed
they will receive a new game grimoire or xdelta
patch weekly, or less frequently if you update
less frequently.

Because production boxes rarely have game installed,
and most games in sorcerer do not run suid or suid
root, the vulnerability and threat potential of 
having games updated weekly is low, while the 
time spent on keeping it up to date is reduced
since it need only be checked and updated once a week.

There are other grimoires available within sorcerer,
and will be more in the future.  Many of the new
grimoires will be specialized for a particular
function or role a box performs, or they may be
particular to a compiler or interpreter that SAs
may choose to install.

If you have an idea for a grimoire that you want
or want to create, or want to maintain then
please post your idea on the sorcerer-spells 
email list.
