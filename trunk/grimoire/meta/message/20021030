If you have sorcery,dev installed on your box
it has now probably been automatically removed
by the addendum.  It is no longer required, 
and was there to smoothly transfer from solo 
branches to concurrent branches.

Extra caching has been added to expedite the
determination of dependencies.  Don't forget
when you make changes to your spells in the
local grimoire to run :

augur merge;  augur index

so that your casting grimoire and index are
updated properly.

P.S.

If your local grimoire
/var/lib/sorcery/grimoire.local
is full of spells that you didn't write, then
rm  -rf  /var/lib/sorcery/grimoire.local
Then, your box will start updating properly.
