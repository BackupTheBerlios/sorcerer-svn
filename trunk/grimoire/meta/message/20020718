Greetings:  Sorcerer system administrator,

This is the sorcery message system which will now
be used to provide you with news and information
about changes in sorcery.

If you are receiving this email multiple times
then you will want to enable message on only
one of your sorcerer boxes.  Disable message
on other sorcery boxes by either using the sorcery 
configuration menus or typing:

echo  "MESSAGE=off"  >>  /etc/sorcery/local.config

Don't forget the >>.  If you use only a > then it 
will overwrite the entire local.configuration instead
of appending to it, and that would cause problems.


Q:  How do you know my email address?

A:  It is sent to the email address specified by SORCERER= 
    in /etc/sorcery/local.config
    I have no idea who you are, where you are, or your 
    email address.  Your personal information will not 
    be sold to others by us, because we don't have it.


Q:  Why?

A:  Because it's easier for you than to check
    http://sorcerer.wox.org/news.html

    It will send you new messages as they available 
    with each grimoire update.

    It is without the hassle of signing up for an email list.

    Old messages will be stored in /var/log/sorcery/message
    thus creating a history on each active Sorcerer box.

    It does not make you more vulnerable to SPAM.


Q:  Who?

A:  The grimoire gurus, tome team, and anyone with 
    write access to the CVS can send out these 
    informational messages.


Q:  How?

A:  It's a one way communication.
    Feedback or replies should be sent through the email lists.
    I might set a replyto address to an email list that one can 
    post to without subscription to make it easier.
    
    However without a subscription to that list you would not
    see what others post to it.


Q:  Often?

A:  Perhaps 50 messages a year plus or minus 25 you will
    receive.


Here's what's new.


DNS for sorcerer.wox.org is restored.  :)


Don't Panic!  apache hasn't been downgraded to 1.x
If you had apache 2.x installed, you still do, however
now it is logged as httpd.  It has probably upgraded to 
httpd 2.0.39, unless you held it.  Please report any 
problems that occur.

apache is now a spell for the 1.x series.  Both the apache and httpd
spells support mod_ssl and mod_perl.  For a PHP apache/httpd module,
simply cast php after the web server is installed.

It is easier to generate self-signed certificates automatically using
the apache spell, than to do so manually while reading the
documentation for httpd 2.x  Yes, you can use the self signed certs
generated by apache 1.x for httpd 2.x

Both directories /etc/httpd and /etc/apache are immutable.
They will not be reaped when the spell is dispelled or updated.
If you ever want a new default httpd.conf, you will need to move
/etc/httpd/httpd.conf or /etc/apache/httpd.conf out of the way.


Do not have gdkxft installed while using gnome2.
It could cause problems logging in via GDM.

I did not find a backdoored configure script for BitchX on the
sorcerer.wox.org source mirror, nor in the BitchX I had downloaded.
However, it was removed from the grimoire, at least temporarily, in 
the paranoid interest of security.


Bug squashing is going good.  Spells have been improved.
Almost no spell of importance is broken.  And the grimoire 
is more current than it has been before.  Still more work, 
testing, and documentation is required before sorcery goes 
stable.  As Sorcerer turns 1 year old this month, progress
and development is strong and quality continues to improve!
