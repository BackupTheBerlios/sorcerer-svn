Sorcerer News for 20030302

Subject:  Goodbye xfree86, hello XFree86.

Please use XFree86 to install XFree86 4.3.0.
XFree86 provides x11, Xft2, and fontconfig.
Consequently, casting XFree86 will dispel
the depreciated xfree86, Xft2 and fontconfig.
The pre-compilation configuration for XFree86 
has been updated to include the new graphic 
and input hardware supported by version 4.3.0.

A major change between the old and new 
spell is that fonts are no longer generated 
and installed during compilation.
Fonts change very little if any 
at all during version upgrades.
It is inefficient to regenerate them 
during each cast and/or upgrade.
Therefore, fonts are now available 
as branch spells in XFree86.
Install them, hold them, forget about them.


Problems?

If logging in using gdm is a problem after upgrading then:
cast -c GConf

If kdm, kde programs, or programs which use qt-x11-free libraries
fail to render fonts after upgrading then:
cast -c qt-x11-free

Since XFree86 4.3.0 supplies libXft.so.1 libXft.so.1.1,
but not the header files for Xft version 1, 
please report problems with spells in the grimoire 
which fail compilation due lack of Xft 1 headers.
