Sorcerer News for 20030510

Subject:  Changes and Improved Services.

/tmp/sorcery requires less space than before.
The previous ccache is now unpacked into the
source build directory into the directory
ccache.  Thus if you were compiling bash
Then the ccache would likely be unpacked into
/usr/src/sorcery/bash-2.05b/ccache

The line in /etc/fstab for /tmp/sorcery should now read:

tmpfs   /tmp/sorcery    tmpfs   defaults,mode=0700,size=128m,nr_inodes=64k 0 0

If you have sufficient RAM + SWAP and want to enable tmpfs on 
/usr/src/sorcery put then add the following line to /etc/fstab

tmpfs   /usr/src/sorcery tmpfs  defaults,mode=0700,size=1g,nr_inodes=1m 0 0


Multiple version hop source upgrade patches are no 
longer generated or stored at sorcerer.wox.org
Because it was unknown whether or not the patches
would be used when most boxes would use only single
version hop patches it was decided that generating
and storing the patches both a waste of disk space,
CPU and other resources.

Multiple version hop patches are now generated on a 
different box with several gigabytes of disk space 
to mitigate the high cost of generating the upgrade patches.
It also has sufficient bandwidth to transport 
those patches to your boxes connected by slow 
modem connections at the full rate possible.
No longer do you need download from sorcerer.wox.org 
or ibiblio.org at 1K/sec when your modem is capable 
of 2.5K/sec or at 2.5K/sec when your modem is capable 
of 5K/sec.

Download singe and multiple version 
hop upgrade patches from cabal.2y.net.
A new beta Install/Rescue ISO9660 has been created.
You can download the xdelta upgrade patch from cabal.2y.net

cabal.2y.net is member supported in order to ensure
sufficient available bandwidth and high performance.
