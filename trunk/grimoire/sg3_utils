      desc 'utilities that send SCSI commands to SCSI devices
As well as devices on transports associated with SCSI
(e.g. Fibre Channel (FCP) and the SCSI Parallel
Interface(SPI)) many other devices use SCSI command sets.
ATAPI cd/dvd drives and SATA disks that use a translation
layer or bridge device are examples of devices that use SCSI command sets.'
