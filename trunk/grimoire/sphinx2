The Sphinx Group at Carnegie Mellon University is committed to
releasing the long-time, DARPA-funded Sphinx projects widely, 
in order to stimulate the creation of speech-using tools and
applications, and to advance the state of the art both directly 
in speech recognition, as well as in related areas including 
dialog systems and speech synthesis.
