      DESC="ufraw is The Unidentified Flying Raw (UFRaw)
ufraw is a utility to read and manipulate raw images from digital cameras.
It can be used on its own or as a Gimp plug-in.
It reads raw images using Dave Coffin's
raw conversion utility - DCRaw (also installs dcraw).
UFRaw supports color management workflow based on Little CMS,
allowing the user to apply ICC color profiles.
For Nikon users UFRaw has the advantage that
it can read the camera's tone curves.
Even if you don't own a Nikon,
you can still apply a Nikon curve to your images."
