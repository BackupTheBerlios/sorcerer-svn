      DESC="boost provides additional C++ libraries.
boost was begun by members of the C++ standards
committee Library Working Group to provide free
peer-reviewed portable libraries to the C++ community.
An additional objective is to establish
existing practice and provide reference
implementations so that the Boost libraries
are suitable for eventual standardization.
Indeed, the explicit intent is to propose many of these
libraries for inclusion in the C++ Standard Library.
The Boost Graph Library, formerly known as the Generic
Graph Component Library (GGCL), is a collection of graph
algorithms and data structures created in the generic
programming style of the Standard Template Library (STL)."
