gc is the Boehm-Demers-Weiser conservative garbage collector.
It can be used as a garbage collecting replacement for C malloc or C++ new.
It is also used by a number of programming language 
implementations that use C as intermediate code.
Alternatively, it may be used as a leak detector for C or C++ programs.
A slightly older version of the garbage collector is 
also included as part of the GNU compiler (gcc) distribution.
