      DESC="wanted is a profile for easily restoring spells the SA wants installed.
Spells become wanted when cast and unwanted when dispelled.
However there are the following exceptions:
1.  An installed spell updates or cast
2.  cast was invoked with -t or --test parameters.

The concept of wanted spells was introduced to enable
grimoire gurus to restore a box to a known and desired
state of installed software by running a single command:
augur restore.

This spell does not offer a fancy
configuration menu like the favor spell does.
To manually change the wanted status of spells
use the augur wanted command."
