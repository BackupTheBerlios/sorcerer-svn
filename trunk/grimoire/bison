bison - Replacement for the parser generator yacc
General purpose parser generator that converts 
a grammar description for a LALR context-free 
grammar into a C program to parse that grammar.
It can be used to create a range of language parsers.
Bison is upwardly compatible with Yacc, so properly 
written Yacc grammars and those users familiar with 
Yacc should have little trouble, although you do 
need to be fluent in C to use Bison.
