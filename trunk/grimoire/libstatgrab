      DESC="$SPELL is a library for cross platform access to system statistics
$SPELL is a library that provides cross platform access 
to statistics about the system on which it's run. It's 
written in C and presents a selection of useful interfaces 
which can be used to access key system statistics. The 
current list of statistics includes CPU usage, memory 
utilisation, disk usage, process counts, network traffic, 
disk I/O, and more.
The package also includes a couple of useful tools. The 
first, saidar, provides a curses-based interface to viewing 
the current state of the system. The second, statgrab, gives 
a sysctl-style interface to the statistics gathered by 
libstatgrab. This extends the use of libstatgrab to people 
writing scripts or anything else that can't easily make C 
function calls. Included with statgrab is a script to 
generate an MRTG configuration file to use statgrab.
