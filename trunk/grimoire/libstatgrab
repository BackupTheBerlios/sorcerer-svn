libstatgrab is a library that provides cross platform
access to statistics about the system on which it is run.
It is written in C and presents a selection of useful
interfaces which can be used to access key system statistics.
The current list of statistics includes CPU usage, memory
utilisation, disk usage, process counts, network traffic,
disk I/O, and more.
The package also includes a couple of useful tools.
The first, saidar, provides a curses-based interface
to viewing the current state of the system.
The second, statgrab, gives a sysctl-style interface
to the statistics gathered by libstatgrab.
This extends the usefulness of libstatgrab
for writing scripts or anything else
that can not easily make C function calls.
Included with statgrab is a script to generate
an MRTG configuration file to use statgrab.'
