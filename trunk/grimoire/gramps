      DESC=("GRAMPS is a genealogical application,"
"the name being an acronym for Genealogical Research and Analysis 
Management Programming System. It allows you to store, edit, and 
research genealogical data, with similar functionality to other 
genealogical programs. However, GRAMPS offers some additional unique
features.
GRAMPS attempts to provide all of the common capabilities of other
genealogical programs, but, more importantly, to provide an additional
capability of integration not common to these programs. This is the 
ability to input any bits and pieces of information directly into GRAMPS
and rearrange/manipulate any/all data events in the entire data base 
(in any order or sequence) to assist the user in doing research, analysis
 and correlation with the potential of filling relationship gaps.
