      DESC="blackshades is a psychic/commando personal protection specialist 3d shooter.

Protect the VIP against overwhelming force of plain clothed 
assassins and on some levels blood thirsty zombies that can 
only be permantly dispatched with a two bullets to the head.
Has simple graphics but fun game play after you learn
the absolutely essential commands in the files:
IF_THIS_IS_A_README_YOU_HAVE_WON  and  Readme

Maybe they will eventually roll a tar.bz2 
for distributing this fun shooter?
Hint: Use the sights on the pistol for decapitating undead.
