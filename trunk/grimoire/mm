      DESC="mm is a library for sharing memory between related processes.
The MM library is a 2-layer abstraction library which simplifies the
usage of shared memory between related processed under Unix
platforms.  It both hides all platform dependent implementation
details (allocation, locking, etc.) when dealing with shared memory
segments and provides a high-level malloc-style API for a convenient
way to work with data-structures inside those shared memory segments."
