      DESC="imlib2 is the successor to imlib graphics library.
imlib2 is the successor to Imlib.
It is NOT a newer version -- it is a completely new library.
Imlib 2 can be installed with Imlib 1.x
without problems since they are different
libraries which have very similar functionality.
Please see the homepage for the
long description of the differences."
