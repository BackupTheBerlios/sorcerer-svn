      desc 'program like top which displays data in analog form
lavaps is an interactive process-tracking program
like top, but with a much different attitude.
Rather than presenting lots of specific info in
digital form, it tries to present certain important
information in a graphical analog form.
The idea is that you can run it in the background
and get a rough idea of what is happening to your
system without devoting much concentration to the task.'
