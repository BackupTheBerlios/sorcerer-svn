A perfect hash function is a hash function and a data 
structure that allows recognition of a key word
in a set of words using exactly 1 probe into the data structure.
Output from the gperf program is used to recognize reserved words
in the GNU C, GNU C++, and GNU Pascal compilers,
as well as with the GNU indent program.'
