      DESC="$SPELL provides 2.6.x stable kernels with suspend capability.
This version is patched to provide software suspend,
aka suspend2.
linux is a clone of the Unix kernel,
written from scratch by Linus Torvalds
with assistance from a loosely-knit
team of hackers across the Net.
It aims towards POSIX and Single
UNIX Specification compliance.
It has all the features you would
expect in a modern fully-fledged
Unix kernel, including true multitasking,
virtual memory, shared libraries,
demand loading, shared copy-on-write
executables, proper memory management,
and TCP/IP networking."
