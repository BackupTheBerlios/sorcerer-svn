      desc 'extension module which expedites the execution of Python code
psyco is a kind of just-in-time (JIT) compiler,
a little bit like Java, that emit machine code on the fly
instead of interpreting your Python program step by step.
The result is that your unmodified Python programs run faster.
The actual performance gains can be very large.
For common code, expect at least a 2x speed-up, more typically 4x.
But where Psyco shines is when running algorithmical
code ---  these are the first pieces of code that
you would consider rewriting in C for performance.
If you are in this situation, consider using Psyco instead!
You might get 10x to 100x speed-ups.
It is theoretically possible to actually speed up
this kind of code up to the performance of C itself.'
