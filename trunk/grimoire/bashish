      desc 'theme engine for the console
Bashish is a theme-engine using bash
and other POSIX shells to customize
nearly all aspects of the terminal:
title, colors, prompt, font, background, etc.
It has a modular design which makes it easy to add features
(and it does have a lot) while keeping good performance.'
