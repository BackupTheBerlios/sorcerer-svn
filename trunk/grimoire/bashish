      DESC="bashish is a theme engine for the console.
Bashish is a theme-engine using bash 
and other POSIX shells to customize 
nearly all aspects of the terminal: 
title, colors, prompt, font, background, etc.
It has a modular design which makes it easy to add features 
(and it does have a lot) while keeping good performance."
