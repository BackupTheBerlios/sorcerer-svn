# cmake build method does notwork with version 1.6a
# it will not properly discover installed boost,
# not even older versions which it should be able to find
# and the -DBoost_ADDITIONA_VERSIONS does nothelp

#      opts -DBoost_ADDITIONAL_VERSIONS=1.38
## I wish that opts would work.
## It works with kde-v4 type spells.
## Even a simple sediting of cmake/FindBoost.cmake did not work.
