ots provides the open text summarizer.
Open Text Summarizer is an open source tool for summarizing text.
It reads a text stream and decides which sentences are important.
It is both a library and a command line tool. External applications,
such as word processors, can link to the library, while the command
line tool summarizes text on the console.
It can output as either plain text or HTML.
When output as HTML, the important sentences are highlighted.
It is multi-lingual and supports UTF-8 encoding.'
