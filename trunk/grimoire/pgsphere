which adds spherical data types. Hence, you can do a fast search
and analysis for objects with spherical traits as used in
geographical, astronomical, or other applications using PostgreSQL.
For instance, you can manage data of geographical objects around
the world and astronomical data like star and other catalogs
conveniently using an SQL interface.'
