Date::Manip is a perl module which allows
for easily parsing and manipulate dates
(several different foreign languages are supported
and more can be added easily,
international date formats are also supported).
A date calculator is also included to tell the

date a certain amount of time from a given date.

business mode where weekends and holidays are ignored.'
