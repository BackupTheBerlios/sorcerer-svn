      desc 'gnome structured file library
libgsf is the GNOME Structured File Library
for reading and writing structured file formats.
Support for MS OLE2 streams is complete, as is zip import.
There is also support for document metadata and
some initial work on decompressing VBA streams in
OLE files for future conversion to other languages.
This library replaces libole2 and is used in
gnumeric, mrproject, and eventually abiword.'
