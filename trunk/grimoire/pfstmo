      DESC='pfstmo provides tone mapping operators
pfstmo package contains the implementation of state-of-the-art 
tone mapping operators. The motivation here is to provide an 
implementation of tone mapping operators suitable for convenient 
processing of both static images and animations.
The operators are embedded in a flexible framework [pfstools] 
which provides a unified input/output mechanism and a modular 
architecture for the filtering of the image data. Various file 
formats for static images and video are transparently supported 
and the High Dynamic Range (HDR) data are processed modularly 
through a Unix piping mechanism.'
