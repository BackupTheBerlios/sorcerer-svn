      desc 'pfstmo provides tone mapping operators
pfstmo package contains the implementation
of state-of-the-art tone mapping operators.
The motivation here is to provide an implementation
of tone mapping operators suitable for convenient
processing of both static images and animations.
The operators are embedded in a flexible framework [pfstools]
which provides a unified input/output mechanism
and a modular architecture for the filtering of the image data.
Various file formats for static images and video
are transparently supported and the High Dynamic Range (HDR) data
are processed modularly through a Unix piping mechanism.'
