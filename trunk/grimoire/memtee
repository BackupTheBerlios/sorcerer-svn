      DESC="memtee buffers file output until memtee recevies term signal.
memtee is a replacement for 'tee' in situations
where no read/write mounted filesystem is available.
In such a case, it buffers all output into
memory and when it receives the TERM signal,
it writes that buffered data into a file."
