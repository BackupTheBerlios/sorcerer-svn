      DESC="pdksh is a public domain version of the Korn Shell.
At the moment, it has most of the ksh88 features,
not much of the ksh93 features,
and a number of its own features.
pdksh was initially created by Eric Gisin using
Charles Forsyth's public domain V7 shell as a
base as well as parts of the BRL shell."
