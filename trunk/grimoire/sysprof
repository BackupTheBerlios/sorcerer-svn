      desc 'sampling CPU profiler that uses a Linux kernel module
It can profile that entire system and not just a single application.
It handles shared libraries, and applications do not need to be recompiled.
It profiles all running processes, not just a single application,
has a nice graphical interface, shows the time spent in each branch
of the call tree, can load and save profiles, and is easy to use.

Sysprof requires a kernel with profiling support compiled in.'
