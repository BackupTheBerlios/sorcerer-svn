      desc 'gmp is the GNU mathematics precision library.
gmp is a library operating on signed integers,
rational numbers, and floating point numbers.
All functions have a standardized interface.
GNUmp is designed to be as fast as possible
by using fullwords as the basic arithmetic type,
by using fast algorithms, by carefully optimizing
assembly code for the most common inner loops for
many CPUs, and by a general emphasis on speed
(as opposed to simplicity or elegance).
GNUmp speed advantage increases with the operand size,
since GNUmp in many cases has asymptomatically faster algorithms.'
