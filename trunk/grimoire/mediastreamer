# mediastreamer version 2.9.0 using portaudio for output
# mandates the installation of speex which is deprecated
# and no longer available software.
# try checking the portaudio elective
# with newer versions of mediastreamer

## Evert reports that --with-glx causes mediastreamer to fail compilation
## However, KS can not replicate the error.
## --disable-glx will only cost performance
## and possibly increase processor utilization
