      DESC='nmap is a utility for network exploration or security auditing.
It supports ping scanning (determine which hosts are up),
many port scanning techniques (determine what services the
hosts are offering), and TCP/IP fingerprinting (remote host
operating system identification).
Nmap also offers flexible target and port specification,
decoy scanning, determination of TCP sequence predictability
characteristics, sunRPC scanning, reverse-identd scanning, and more.
Console and X-Window versions are available.'
