# Short-Description: rpc.mountd is a server that accepts mount requests from NFS clients.
# Description: rpc.mountd implements the NFS mount protocol.
#	When receiving a MOUNT request from an NFS client, it checks the
#	request against the list of currently exported file systems.
#	If the client is permitted to mount the file system,  
#	rpc.mountd obtains a file handle for requested directory
#	and returns it to the client.
