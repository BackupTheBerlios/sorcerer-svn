E-pad is a portable, commandline-driven encryption program.
It is based upon the symmetric-key 
cryptosystem known as the one-time pad.
It will encrypt or decrypt any file 
with any key regardless of filetype.
It is designed with usability in mind, 
but it is also well-suited to work in
batch files or shell scripts.
