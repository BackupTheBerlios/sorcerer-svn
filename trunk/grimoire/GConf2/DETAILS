GConf is a system for storing configuration information, that is,
key-value pairs.  GConf provides a notification service so applications
can be notified when a key's value is changed.  GConf also allows for
pluggable storage mechanisms (text files, databases, etc.); allows
administrators to install default values; and allows application authors
to document their configuration keys for the benefit of administrators.
