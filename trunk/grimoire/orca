From README:

Orca is a free, open source, flexible, and extensible
screen reader that provides access to the graphical desktop
via user-customizable combinations of speech, braille, and/or magnification.
Under development by the Sun Microsystems, Inc.,
Accessibility Program Office since 2004,
Orca has been created with early input from
and continued engagement with its end users.'
