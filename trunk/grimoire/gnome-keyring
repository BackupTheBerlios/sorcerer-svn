      desc 'gnome-keyring keeps passwords and secrets for users.
It is run as a damon in the session, similar to ssh-agent,
and other applications can locate it by an environment variable.
The program can manage several keyrings, each with its own master
password, and there is also a session keyring which is never
stored to disk, but forgotten when the session ends.'
