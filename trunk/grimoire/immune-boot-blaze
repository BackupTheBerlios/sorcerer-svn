      desc "accelerates booting

Minimal portions of disk I/O and CPU cycles
are used to temporarily cache files opened during booting.
When files are read the content might already
be in the kernel's cache.
Consequently, boot speed might improve.
To start fresh execute:
rm -f /etc/boot-blaze"

build(){
 mkdir  -pvm 755 $DESTDIR/usr/sbin
 install -vm 700 $SCRIPT_DIR/boot-blaze $DESTDIR/usr/sbin/
}
