      DESC="krystaldrop is a clone of NeoGeo's Magical Drop.
In it, you play on a field on which lines of gems are 
being dropped by the top of the screen, at a regular 
basis or when your opponent makes a combo.
You can take or drop gems from the bottom 
of the screen to make gems disappear. 
If you move gems in order to create a 
vertical alignment of at least three gems 
of the same colour, they will burst and 
start a chain reaction with all 
neighbouring matching gems.
The aim is to prepare some other chain reactions 
while the first gems are bursting, in order to 
make a combo and send lines to your opponent.
You lose when some gems reach the bottom of the field."
