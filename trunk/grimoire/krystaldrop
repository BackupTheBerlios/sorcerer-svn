      desc 'clone of NeoGeo Magical Drop
In it, you play on a field on which lines of gems are
being dropped by the top of the screen, at a regular
basis or when your opponent makes a combo.
You can take or drop gems from the bottom
of the screen to make gems disappear.
If you move gems in order to create a
vertical alignment of at least three gems
of the same colour, they will burst and
start a chain reaction with all
neighbouring matching gems.
The aim is to prepare some other chain reactions
while the first gems are bursting, in order to
make a combo and send lines to your opponent.
You lose when some gems reach the bottom of the field.'
