      DESC="netselect finds the best of a set of mirrors.
netselect is an ultrafast intelligent parallelizing
binary-search implementation of ping.
It determines several facts about all of the hosts
given on the command line, much faster than you would
if you manually tried to use ping and traceroute.
It selects the best of them to use as a download
mirror based on the results.
Unfortuantely netselect provides no indication
of which server provides the fastest throughput."
