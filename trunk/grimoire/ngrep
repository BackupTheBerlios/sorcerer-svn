      DESC="ngrep is utility that can be used to analyze network packets.
ngrep strives to provide most of GNU grep's common
features applied applying them to the network layer.
ngrep is a pcap-aware tool that will allow you to
specify extended regular or hexadecimal expressions
to match against data payloads of packets.
It currently recognizes TCP, UDP, and ICMP across Ethernet,
PPP, SLIP, FDDI, Token Ring, and null interfaces,
and understands bpf filter logic in the same fashion as
more common packet sniffing tools, such as tcpdump and snoop."
