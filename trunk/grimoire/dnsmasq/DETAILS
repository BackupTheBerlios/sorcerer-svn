      DESC="dnsmasq is a DNS forwarder for NAT firewalls.
dnsmasq is lightweight, easy to configure DNS forwarder 
designed to provide DNS (domain name) services to a 
small network where using BIND would be overkill. 
It can have its upstream DNS servers automatically 
configured by PPP or DHCP, and it can serve the names 
of local machines which are not in the global DNS.
It can integrate with the ISC DHCP daemon to serve the 
names of local machines which are configured using DHCP.
Dnsmasq is ideal for networks behind NAT routers and 
connected via modem, ISDN, ADSL, or cable-modem connections."
