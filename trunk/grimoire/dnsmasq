      desc 'DNS forwarder for NAT firewalls
dnsmasq is lightweight, easy to configure DNS forwarder
designed to provide DNS (domain name) services to a
small network where using BIND would be overkill.
It can have its upstream DNS servers automatically
configured by PPP or DHCP, and it can serve the names
of local machines which are not in the global DNS.
It can integrate with the ISC DHCP daemon to serve the
names of local machines which are configured using DHCP.
Dnsmasq is ideal for networks behind NAT routers and
connected via modem, ISDN, ADSL, or cable-modem connections.'
