      desc 'WYSIWYG scientific TeX editor
The program implements high-quality typesetting using TeX fonts,
but it is also provides a user-friendly interface.
Finally, TeXmacs supports the Guile/Scheme extension language,
which makes it possible to adapt the user interface to
specific needs and even to extend the editor.'
