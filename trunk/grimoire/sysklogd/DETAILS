sysklogd implements two traditional 
system and kernel logging daemons.
The syslogd daemon is the general system logging daemon 
which is responsible for handling requests for syslog services.
This version of syslogd is similar to the standard Berkeley 
product but with a number of compatible extensions.
The klogd daemon runs either standalone or as a client of syslogd.
Klogd 'listens' to kernel log messages, prioritizes them, 
and routes them to either output files or to syslogd.
This version of klogd will optionally translate kernel addresses 
to their symbolic equivalents if provided with a system map.
