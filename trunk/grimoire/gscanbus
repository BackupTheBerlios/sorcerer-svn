with info    cite 'topology visualizing tool for the Linux IEEE1394 subsystem
gscanbus is a little bus scanning, testing and topology visualizing
tool for the Linux IEEE1394 subsystem, with some AV/C support,
especially for controlling Camcorders and VCRs.
It is intended as a debugging tool for IEEE1394 development,
but can also be used to simply check your IEEE1394 setup on Linux.'
