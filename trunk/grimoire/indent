      DESC="indent reformats C code in various indentation styles
GNU indent changes the appearance of a C program by inserting
or deleting whitespace according to a plethora of options.
Some canned styles of formatting are supported as well.
GNU indent is a descendant of BSD indent.

GNU indent does NOT work for C++,
if it does for you then you're just lucky.
Don't ask for support for C++."
