      DESC="gutenprint is a collection of very high quality printer drivers.
gutenprint was formerly known as gimp-print.
The goal of this project is uncompromising 
print quality and robustness.
Included with this package is the Print
plugin for the GIMP (hence the former name), 
a CUPS driver, and a driver for Ghostscript 
that may be compiled into that package.
This driver package is Foomatic-compatible 
to enable plug and play with many print spoolers.
In addition, various printer maintenance 
utilities are included."
