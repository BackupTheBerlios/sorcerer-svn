      DESC="rdate synchronizes system clocks with another networked box.

The rdate utility retrieves the date and time from another
machine on your network, using the protocol described in RFC 868.
If you run rdate as root, it will set your machine's local 
time to the time of the machine that you queried.
Note that rdate is not scrupulously accurate.
If you are worried about milliseconds, install the xntp3
package, which includes the xntpd daemon, instead."
