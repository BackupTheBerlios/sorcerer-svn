      DESC="slibo is a 2D/3D chess interface for KDE.
It uses the xboard protocol and can be used with common chess engines
like crafty or gnuchess, but it provides its own chess engine too.
Though its designed to be easy to use for the new chess
player, it supports playing multiple games the same time,
or anaylzing PGN files with multiple engines."
