      desc 'fast lexical analyser generator
flex is a fast lexical analyser generator.
It is a tool for generating programs
that perform pattern-matching on text.
There are many applications for Flex,
including writing  compilers in
conjunction with GNU Bison.
Flex is a free implementation
of the well known Lex program.
It features a Lex compatibility mode,
and also provides several new features
such as exclusive start conditions.'
