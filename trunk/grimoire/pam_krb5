with info    cite 'kerberos 5 module for Linux-PAM
Using pam_krb5 a box can use heimdal kerberos 5 implementation
or MIT kerberos 5 implementation to authneticate with any
program compiled to use Linux-PAM.
pam-krb5 provides a Kerberos v5 PAM module that supports authentication,
user ticket cache handling, simple authorization
(via .k5login or checking Kerberos principals against local usernames),
and password changing.
It can be configured through either options in the PAM configuration
itself or through entries in the system krb5.conf file,
and it tries to work around PAM implementation flaws
in commonly-used PAM-enabled applications such as OpenSSH and xdm.'
