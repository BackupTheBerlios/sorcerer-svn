      desc 'dhcpv6 is a stateful address autoconfiguration protocol for IPv6,
a counterpart to IPv6 stateless address autoconfiguration protocol.
It can either be used independently or it can coexist
with its counterpart protocol.
This protocol uses client/server mode of operation
but can also provide support through a Relay Agent.'
