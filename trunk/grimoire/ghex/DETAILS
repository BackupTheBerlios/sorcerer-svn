GHex is a simple binary editor, allowing the user to view and edit a
binary file in both hex and ascii with multiple level undo/redo
mechanism.  It features find and replace functions and conversion
between binary, octal, decimal and hexadecimal values, making use of
an alternative, user-configurable MDI concept to allow the user to
edit multiple documents with multiple views of each.
