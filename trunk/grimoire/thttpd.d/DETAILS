      DESC="thttpd is a throttling httpd server.
thttpd is a simple, small, fast and secure HTTP server.
It doesn't have a lot of special features
but it suffices for most uses of the web.
It is faster than Apache and it has one extremely useful feature
(URL-traffic-based throttling) that no other server currently has."
