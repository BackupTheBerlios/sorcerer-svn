      DESC="gawk is a free version of awk.
gawk performs simple data reformatting tasks, 
such as making changes in various text files 
whenever certain patterns appear or extracting 
data from parts of certain lines while 
discarding the rest, with just a few lines of code.
It provides several useful extensions 
not found in other implementations.
It is upwardly compatible with the 
latest POSIX specification of awk."
