gawk performs simple data reformatting tasks,
such as making changes in various text files
whenever certain patterns appear or extracting
data from parts of certain lines while
discarding the rest, with just a few lines of code.
It provides several useful extensions
not found in other implementations.
It is upwardly compatible with the
latest POSIX specification of awk.'
