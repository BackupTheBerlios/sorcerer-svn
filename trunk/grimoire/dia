Dia is a program for creating diagrams of all kinds.
The current version can do UML class diagrams, 
Entity-Relationship modeling, network diagrams, and much more.
The engine is very flexible and dynamically 
loads diagram-types from disk.  
It can currently export to PostScript 
and load/save in an XML format."
