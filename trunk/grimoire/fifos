      DESC="fifos is a program that buffers piped data.

fifos is a program that can be inserted into a 
command pipeline that takes data on standard 
input and writes it to standard output.
It will measure the input and output rates and create a buffer
of the appropriate size needed to buffer the entire stream.
fifos is useful for streaming media to programs 
that cannot buffer data appropriately themselves.
