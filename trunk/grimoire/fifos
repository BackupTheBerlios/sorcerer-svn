      desc "fifos is a program that buffers piped data.

fifos is a program that can be inserted into a
command pipeline that takes data on standard
input and writes it to standard output.
It will measure the input and output rates and create a buffer
of the appropriate size needed to buffer the entire stream.
fifos is useful for streaming media to programs
that cannot buffer data appropriately themselves."
