      desc 'Squeak is a SmallTalk Development system.
Squeak is an OpenSource and super-portable implementation of a 
multi-media capable Smalltalk-80 
based object-oriented programming environment.
It is written entirely in Smalltalk and has a 
high-performance VM, created by compiling the 
Smalltalk VM code into efficient and portable C code.
It now uses the Self language Morphic User Interface 
but still provides the original MVC GUI as well.
To run squeak first copy the Image file from /usr/share/squeak 
to your home directory and call the file squeak.image'
