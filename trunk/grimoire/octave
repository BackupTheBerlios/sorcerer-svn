      DESC="octave is a high-level language, primarily intended for numerical computations.
It provides a convenient command line interface for solving linear
and nonlinear problems numerically, and for performing other numerical
experiments using a language that is mostly compatible with Matlab.
It may also be used as a batch-oriented language."
