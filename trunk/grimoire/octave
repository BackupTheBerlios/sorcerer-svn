      DESC="GNU octave is a high-level language, primarily intended for numerical 
computations. It provides a convenient command line interface for solving 
linear and nonlinear problems numerically, and for performing other 
numerical experiments using a language that is mostly compatible with 
Matlab. It may also be used as a batch-oriented language."
