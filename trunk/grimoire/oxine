with info    cite 'OSD-based, on screen display, xine frontend
oxine is a lightweight, purely OSD-based xine frontend
for set-top boxes and home entertainment systems.
It uses the on screen display functionality
of xine to display its user interface elements
like buttons, lists, sliders, and so on.
Due to this, oxine can easily use any
video output device the xine library provides.'
