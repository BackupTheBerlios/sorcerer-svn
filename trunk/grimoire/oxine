      LONG="
oxine is a lightweight, purely OSD-based xine frontend 
for set-top boxes and home entertainment systems.
It uses the on screen display functionality 
of xine to display its user interface elements 
like buttons, lists, sliders, and so on.
Due to this, oxine can easily use any 
video output device the xine library provides.
