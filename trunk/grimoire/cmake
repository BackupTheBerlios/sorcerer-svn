# /usr/share/cmake-2.8/Modules/FindOpenSSL.cmake
# Does not properly detect the installed location of openssl's libraries
# on x86_64 multilib architecture
# when doing -m32 compilation
# However, cmake version 2.8.4 works fine for that.
# When testing cmake version > 2.8.5
# do a compile test on mysql to see if it passes or fails

# cmake version 2.8.6 breaks compilation of mysql
# cmake version 2.8.8 breaks compilation of mysql
# cmake version 2.8.8 fails to properly detect which ELF version
# of installed OpenSSL to use.
# 2.8.10.2 not yet tested
