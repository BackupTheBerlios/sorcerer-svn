ProFTPD is a proven, high-performance, scalable FTP server written
from scratch, with a focus toward simplicity, security, and ease of
configuration.  It features a very Apache-like configuration syntax,
modules, and a highly customizable server infrastructure, including
support for multiple 'virtual' FTP servers, anonymous FTP, and
permission-based directory visibility.
