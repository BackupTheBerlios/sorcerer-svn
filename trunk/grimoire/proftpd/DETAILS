proftpd is a proven, high-performance, scalable 
FTP server written from scratch, with a focus 
toward simplicity, security, and ease of configuration.
It features a very Apache-like configuration syntax,
modules, and a highly customizable server infrastructure, 
including support for multiple 'virtual' FTP servers, 
anonymous FTP, and permission-based directory visibility.
