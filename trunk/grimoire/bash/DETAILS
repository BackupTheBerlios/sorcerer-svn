      DESC="bash is the shell of the GNU operating system.

Bash is an sh-compatible shell that incorporates useful
features from the Korn shell (ksh) and C shell (csh).
It is intended to conform to the
IEEE POSIX P1003.2/ISO 9945.2 Shell and Tools standard.
It offers functional improvements over sh for both
programming and interactive use; these include command
line editing, unlimited size command history, job control,
shell functions and aliases, indexed arrays of unlimited size,
and integer arithmetic in any base from two to sixty-four.
In addition, most sh scripts can be run by Bash without modification."
