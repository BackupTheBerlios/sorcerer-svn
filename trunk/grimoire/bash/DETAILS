bash - Shell of the GNU operating system.
Bash is an sh-compatible shell that incorporates useful 
features from the Korn shell (ksh) and C shell (csh).
It is intended to conform to the 
IEEE POSIX P1003.2/ISO 9945.2 Shell and Tools standard.
It offers functional improvements over sh for both 
programming and interactive use; these include command 
line editing, unlimited size command history, job control, 
shell functions and aliases, indexed arrays of unlimited size, 
and integer arithmetic in any base from two to sixty-four.
In addition, most sh scripts can be run by Bash without modification.
