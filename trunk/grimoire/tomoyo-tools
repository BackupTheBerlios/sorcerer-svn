Definitely read the documentation.
tomoyo 2.4.x releases are for use with linux version 3.1.x.y kernels.
tomoyo 2.3.x releases are for use with linux version 3.0.x.y kernels.
tomoyo security model is not enabled automatically.
It must be enabled using a kernel parameter.
For juicy examples of how tomoyo can be used
for more than merely to control access to and execution of files
the website below shows examples of how a secondary authentication
method can be required after successfully sshing into a box.

http://tomoyo.sourceforge.jp/2.3/chapter-10.html.en

tomyo has a method for learning and editing access lists.
However, setting up access lists can be arduous labor
and the quality of the policy determines the enhanced
quality of protection.
In other words enhancing security with tomoyo
is more a work of art than science.

When comparing examples
with actual output from a Sorcerer box
then please be aware that the real root file system
is mounted as /media/root/
Therefore, /usr/sbin/httpd will appear to run as
/media/root/usr/sbin/httpd
