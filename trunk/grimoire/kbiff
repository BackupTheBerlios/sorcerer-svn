kbiff is a kde biff or new mail notification utility.
It is highly configurable but very easy to use and setup.
It supports session managment (it remembers the last
state it was in before you logged off) and can be docked
into the panel.
It has support for mbox (Unix-style), maildir (qmail-style),
mh, POP3, IMAP4, and NNTP mailboxes.'
