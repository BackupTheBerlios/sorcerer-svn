$SHORT
selinux currently requires running linux,v2.6 or linux,v2.6-grsecurity.
NSA Security-enhanced Linux is a set of patches to the Linux kernel 
and some utilities to incorporate a strong, flexible mandatory 
access control architecture into the major subsystems of the kernel.
It provides a mechanism to enforce the separation of 
information based on confidentiality and integrity requirements, 
which allows threats of tampering and bypassing of application 
security mechanisms to be addressed and enables the confinement 
of damage that can be caused by malicious or flawed applications.
It includes a set of sample security policy configuration files 
designed to meet common, general-purpose security goals.
