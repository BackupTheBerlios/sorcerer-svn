Make examines a set of related files, determines 
which of them are out of date, and runs just the 
commands necessary to bring them back up to date. 
Make is typically used to compile and link programs, 
but it can be useful in many other situations as well.
Make reads a file called a makefile to learn how 
the files in your program are put together.
It may also contain rules to install the product, 
clear up the workspace, generate distribution 
packages, or other tasks.
When you write a program, you should also create a
makefile for it so that it is possible to use Make 
to build and install it.'
