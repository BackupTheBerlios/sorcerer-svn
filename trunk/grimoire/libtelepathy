The Telepathy project aims to provide a unified framework for all forms 
of real time conversations, including instant messaging, IRC, voice 
calls and video calls.
It uses the D-Bus messaging system to provide a simple interface
for client applications, allowing them to quickly benefit from
Telepathy functionality.

At the core of Telepathy is the DBus interface specification which
describes how Telepathy components communicate with each other.
We are up to spec version 0.16 (see DbusSpec for older versions).
For a more approachable introduction to the structure of the framework,
try the System Overview document. The Ubuntu spec for SIP/IM
integration includes a good rationale for this distributed approach.'
