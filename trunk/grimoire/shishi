It can be used to authenticate users in distributed systems.
It contains a library that can be used by application developers,
and a command line utility for users.
Shishi supports Kerberos authenticated telnet
client/server, IMAP client/server (via GSSAPI),
SSH client/server (via GSSAPI), rsh/rlogin client,
and a PAM module for host security.

To use shishi kerberos 5 implementation for distributed authentication
requires further manual configuration according to the manul available
at the URL below.
