From the gvfs/README

gvfs is a userspace virtual filesystem designed to work
with the i/o abstractions of gio
(a library availible in glib >= 2.15.1).
It installs several modules that are automatically
used by applications using the APIs of libgio.
There is also fuse support that allows
applications not using gio to access the gvfs filesystems.'
