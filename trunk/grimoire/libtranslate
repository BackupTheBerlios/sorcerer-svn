      DESC="libtranslate is a library for translating.
It translates text and Web pages between natural languages.
Its modular infrastructure allows the user to implement
new translation services separately from the core library.
libtranslate is shipped with a generic module that supports 
Web-based translation services such as Babel Fish,
Google Language Tools, and SYSTRAN.
Moreover, the generic module allows new services to
be added simply by adding a few lines to an XML file.
The libtranslate distribution includes a powerful command line interface."
