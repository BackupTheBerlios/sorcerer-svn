      desc 'PyQt is a set of Python bindings for Nokias Qt 
application framework and runs on all platforms supported by Qt 
including Windows, MacOS/X and Linux. There are two sets of bindings: 
PyQt v4 supports Qt v4; and the older PyQt v3 supports Qt v3 and 
earlier. The bindings are implemented as a set of Python modules 
and contain over 300 classes and over 6,000 functions and methods.'
