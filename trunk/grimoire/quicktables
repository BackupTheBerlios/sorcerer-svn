      DESC="quicktables is a firewall/Nat script generator.

quicktables is an iptables firewall/NAT (gateway) script generator.
It was created to quickly provide a secure set of iptables rules.
It will ask you to answer a small handful of questions, 
and generates your very own personalized firewall script.
It supports NAT and no NAT (firewall only) options, 
default policy of DROP on INPUT and FORWARD chains 
(all packets dropped), TCP and UDP ACCEPTs on INPUT chain 
(open ports to the firewall machine), TCP and UPD port forwarding 
with NAT (forward ports  to multiple internal hosts--NAT only), 
multiple ICMP (ping) options, multiple logging options 
(syslog - kern.info), and explicit host drops.
