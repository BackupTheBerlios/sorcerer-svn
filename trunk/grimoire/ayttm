stream << EOF
ayttm is an instant messenger program, supporting various 
protocols such as MSN, Yahoo, AIM, Jabber, and more.
It is a fork of Everybuddy, 
and initially aims to address its problems. 
It should not segfault when you use it, and 
should be almost instantly usable by your mother.
Almost useless prefs should be hidden, 
reserved for "advanced" users,
and things have to work without wondering 
what this or that will produce.
