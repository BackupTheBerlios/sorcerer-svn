# Somewhere there is probably a patch for zip 2.3 to prevent
# a buffer-overrun vulnerability relating to deep directory paths 
# that could potentially lead to local privilege escalation 
# (e.g., in the case of automated, Zip-based backups).
# oddly the info-zip website does not provide the patch.
