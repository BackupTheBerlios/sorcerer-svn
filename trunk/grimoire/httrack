      desc 'multi-thread and feature-rich offline browser
httrack is an easy-to-use offline browser utility.
It allows you to download a Web site from the
Internet to a local directory, building recursively
all directories, getting HTML, images, and other
files from the server to your computer.
HTTrack arranges the original site relative link-structure.
Simply open a page of the mirrored Web site in your browser,
and you can browse the site from link to link, as if you
were viewing it online.
HTTrack can also update an existing mirrored
site, and resume interrupted downloads.'
