# libpng upgrade broke Scorched3D version 43.3d and
# the typical fix is not working because the source is
# ignoring environment variables LDFLAGS and PKG_CONFIG_PATH

# requires it's own special static FFTW in order to compile.
# Uncertain if FFTW is still required in source tree
# since Scorched3D is failing to compile due to it's requirement
# on ancient libpng API

# compiles and runs fine, but crashes when starting a game.
# says foam must be a 128x128 texture or something like that.

# requires more editing to become compatible with current libpng
