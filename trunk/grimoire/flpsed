      DESC="$SPELL is a WYSIWYG pseudo PostScript (and PDF) editor
Pseudo, because you can't remove or modify existing 
elements of a document. But flpsed lets you add 
arbitrary text lines to existing PostScript 1 documents. 
Added lines can later be reedited with flpsed. Using 
pdftops, which is part of xpdf one can convert PDF documents 
to PostScript and also add text to them. flpsed is useful for 
filling in forms (even in batch mode), adding notes etc.
