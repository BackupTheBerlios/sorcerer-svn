      DESC="flpsed is a WYSIWYG pseudo PostScript (and PDF) editor
flpsed is pseudo, because you can not remove
or modify existing elements of a document.
But flpsed lets you add arbitrary text lines
to existing PostScript 1 documents. 
Added lines can later be reedited with flpsed.
By using pdftops, which is part of xpdf, PDF documents
can be converted to PostScript and have text added to them.
flpsed is useful for filling in forms (even in batch mode),
adding notes etc."
