      DESC="perl--SOAP-Lite-SmartProxy provides perl module to redirect a SOAP client
The SmartProxy package is intended for use in a multi-server setting where
one or more servers may not be directly accessible to client side scripts.
The SmartProxy package makes request redirection and forwarding on a per class
basis easy.  Client scripts need not know which server is appropriate for a
specific request and may make all requests from a single master server which
can be relied upon to redirect clients to the server currently fulfilling a
given request.  The relieves a maintenance burden on the client side.
The server may also redirect clients to a new class name or fully qualified
action URI (methods and arguments are assumed to remain constant however)."
