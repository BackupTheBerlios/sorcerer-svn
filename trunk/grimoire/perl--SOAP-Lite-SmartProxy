      desc 'perl--SOAP-Lite-SmartProxy provides perl module to redirect a SOAP client
The SmartProxy package is intended for use in a multi-server setting where
one or more servers may not be directly accessible to client side scripts.
The SmartProxy package makes request redirection
and forwarding on a per class basis easy.
Client scripts need not know which server
is appropriate for a specific request
and may make all requests from a single master server
which can be relied upon to redirect clients
to the server currently fulfilling a given request.
The relieves a maintenance burden on the client side.
The server may also redirect clients to a new class name
or fully qualified action URI
(methods and arguments are assumed to remain constant however).'
