ucl is a portable lossless data compression library written in ANSI C.
UCL implements a number of compression algorithms that achieve an
excellent compression ratio while allowing *very* fast decompression. 
Decompression requires no additional memory.
UCL is an OpenSource re-implementation of some NRV compression algorithms.
