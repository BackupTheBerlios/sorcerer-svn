The ncurses (new curses) library is a free software
emulation of curses in System V Release 4.0 and more.

and multiple highlights and forms chracters and
function-key mapping, and has all the other
SYSV-curses enhancements over BSD curses.
The distribution includes the library and support
utilities, including a terminfo compiler tic,
