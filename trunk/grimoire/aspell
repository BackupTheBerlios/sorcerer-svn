      desc 'spell checker designed to eventually replace ispell
aspell is a spell checker designed to eventually replace ispell.
Its main feature is that it does a much better job of
coming up with possible suggestions than ispell does.
It also has support for checking (La)TeX and HTML files,
and run-time support for other non-English languages.'
