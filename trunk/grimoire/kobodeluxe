      DESC="kobodeluxe is an enhanced port of the scrolling video game XKobo.
kobodeluxe is a 3'rd person scrolling 2d shooter with a simple
and responsive control system - which you'll need to tackle the
tons of enemy ships that shoot at you, chase you, circle around
you shooting, or even launch other ships at you, while you're
trying to destroy the labyrinth shaped bases.
There are 50 action packed levels with smoothly increasing
difficulty, and different combinations of enemies that require
different tactics to be dealt with successfully."
