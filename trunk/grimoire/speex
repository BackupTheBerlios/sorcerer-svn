      DESC="speex is a library voice codec.

speex is a patent-free, Open Source/Free Software voice codec.
Unlike other codecs like MP3 and Ogg Vorbis,
Speex is designed to compress voice at low 
bitrates in the 8-32 kbps/channel range.
Possible applications include:
  VoIP, 
  internet audio streaming,
  archiving of speech data (e.g. voice mail),
  and audio books.
In some sense, it is meant to be 
complementary to the Ogg Vorbis codec.
