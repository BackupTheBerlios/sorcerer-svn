RCS -Revision Control Software,
is used for keeping revisions of files etc.
It can be used for system maintenance, BIND zone

# Quick note:
# RCS doesn't like to be compiled as root, as the make is
# doing several of the tests, and these tests need to be executed
# as a non-root user :(
# that's the reason for the chown & su to user bin!!!!
