      DESC="normalize is a WAV file volume normalizer
normalize is a tool for adjusting the 
volume of WAV files to a standard level.
This is useful for things like creating 
mixed CD's and mp3 collections, where 
different recording levels on different
albums can cause the volume to vary 
greatly from song to song."
