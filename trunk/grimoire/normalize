      desc 'normalize is a WAV file volume normalizer
normalize is a tool for adjusting the
volume of WAV files to a standard level.
This is useful for things like creating
mixed CD and mp3 collections, where
different recording levels on different
albums can cause the volume to vary
greatly from song to song.'
