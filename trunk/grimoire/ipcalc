       desc 'ipcalc calculates broadcast, network, Cisco mask, and host range
ipcalc takes an IP address and netmask and calculates
the resulting broadcast, network, Cisco wildcard mask,
and host range.
By giving a second netmask, you can design subnets and supernets.
It is also intended to be a teaching tool and presents 
the subnetting results as easy-to-understand binary values.'
