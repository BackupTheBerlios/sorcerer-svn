      DESC="nfs-utils provides utilities for the NFS, Network File System.
The Network File System (NFS) was developed to allow machines to mount
a disk partition on a remote machine as if it were on a local hard drive.
This allows for fast, seamless sharing of files across a network.
Read the Security section of the NFS-HOWTO
if you intend to implement an NFS setup."
