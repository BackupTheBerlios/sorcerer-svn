nfs-utils provides utilities for the NFS, Network File System.
The Network File System (NFS) was developed to allow machines to mount
a disk partition on a remote machine as if it were on a local hard drive.
This allows for fast, seamless sharing of files across a network.

It also gives the potential for unwanted people to 
access your hard drive over the network (and thereby 
possibly read your email and delete all your files as 
well as break into your system) if you set it up incorrectly.
So please read the Security section of the NFS-HOWTO
carefully if you intend to implement an NFS setup.
