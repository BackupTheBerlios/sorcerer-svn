      desc "multicast DNS support library for glibc's NSS
nss-mdns is plugin for the GNU NSS functionality of glibc
which provides host name resolution via Multicast DNS
(a.k.a. Zeroconf, a.k.a. Apple Rendezvous, a.k.a Apple Bonjour).
This effectively allows name resolution by common Unix/Linux
programs in the ad-hoc mDNS domain .local."
