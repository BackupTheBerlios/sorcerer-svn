      DESC="exult is an open-source game engine for playing Ultima7

exult is an open-source game engine for playing Ultima7 on modern
operating systems, using the game's original data files.
If you don't own Ultima 7 this engine will be of no use to you.
To get sound & midi working on this you will likely have to shut
down artsd and run esd before starting exult.
