      DESC="ggz-grubby is a chatbot for ggz.

This package contains grubby, the almighty chatbot.
It's a single binary, but it is very flexible and 
extensible by plugins and scripts.

Grubby is intended to be used on 
servers so it doesn't miss players,
but it is in fact a client program.

It reads all necessary startup information 
from ~/.ggz/grubby.rc and runs as long as 
it isn't shut down by its owner.
