      LONG="
librsync is a free software library that 
implements the rsync remote-delta algorithm.
This algorithm allows efficient remote updates of a file, 
without requiring the old and new versions to both be 
present at the sending end.
The library uses a streaming design similar to that of zlib with 
the aim of allowing it to be embedded into many different applications.
