      DESC='libcdio encapsulates CD-ROM reading and control.
Applications wishing to be oblivious of the OS- and
device-dependent properties of a CD-ROM can use this library.
Some support for disk image types like BIN/CUE and NRG is available,
so applications that use this library also have the ability to read
disc images as though they were CDs.
A sample utility for displaying CD info is included,
as is a library for working with ISO-9660 filesystems.'
