The Network Information Service (NIS) provides a simple 
network lookup service consisting of databases and processes.
It was formerly known as Sun Yellow Pages (YP).
The functionality of the two remains 
the same, only the name has changed.
Its purpose is to provide information, that has to be known 
throughout the network, to all machines on the network.
