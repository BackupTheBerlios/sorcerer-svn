      desc 'djvulibre is a library for a document format
DjVu is a web-centric format and software platform for distributing
documents and images. DjVu can advantageously replace PDF, PS, TIFF,
JPEG, and GIF for distributing scanned documents, digital documents,
or high-resolution pictures. DjVu content downloads faster,
displays and renders faster, looks nicer on a screen,
and consume less client resources than competing formats.
DjVu images display instantly and can be smoothly zoomed
and panned with no lengthy re-rendering.'
