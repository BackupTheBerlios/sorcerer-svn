DjVu is a web-centric format and software platform
for distributing documents and images.
DjVu can advantageously replace PDF, PS, TIFF, JPEG, and GIF
for distributing scanned documents, digital documents,
or high-resolution pictures.
DjVu content downloads faster, displays and renders faster,
looks nicer on a screen, and consume less client resources
than competing formats.
DjVu images display instantly and can be smoothly zoomed
and panned with no lengthy re-rendering.'
