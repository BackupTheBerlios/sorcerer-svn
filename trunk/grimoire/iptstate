      desc 'state top for iptables
IP Tables State (iptstate) was originally written to implement
the state top feature of IP Filter in IP Tables. 
State top displays the states held by your stateful
firewall in a top-like manner.
Since IP Tables does not have a built in way to easily display 
this information even once, an option was added to just have it 
display the state table once.
Features include:
  - Top-like realtime state table information
  - Sorting by any field
  - Reversible sorting
  - Single display of state table
  - Customizable refresh rate
  - Display filtering
  - Color-coding
  - Open Source (using the zlib license)
  - much more...'
