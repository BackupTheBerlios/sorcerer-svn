IP Tables State (iptstate) was originally written to implement
the state top feature of IP Filter in IP Tables. 
State top displays the states held by your stateful
firewall in a top-like manner.
Since IP Tables does not have a built in way to easily display 
this information even once, an option was added to just have it 
display the state table once.
Features include:
  - Top-like realtime state table information
  - Sorting by any field
  - Reversible sorting
  - Single display of state table
  - Customizable refresh rate
  - Display filtering
  - Color-coding
  - Open Source (using the zlib license)
  - much more...'
