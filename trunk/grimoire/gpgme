gpgme GnuPG Made Easy (GPGME) is a library designed
to make access to gnupg easier for applications.
It provides a High-Level Crypto API for encryption,
decryption, signing, signature verification and key management.
Currently it uses GnuPG as the backend
but the API is not restricted to this engine;
in fact it is planned to add other backends to it.'
