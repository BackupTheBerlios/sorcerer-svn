 freshmeat python
      desc 'interpreted, interactive, object-oriented programming language
It combines remarkable power with very
clear syntax, and is not difficult to learn.
It has modules, classes, exceptions, very
high level data types, and dynamic typing.
There are interfaces to many system calls
and libraries, as well as to various
windowing systems
(Tk, Mac, MFC, GTK+, Qt, wxWindows).
Newbuilt-in modules are easily written in C or C++.
Python is also usable as an extension language for
applications that need a programmable interface.'
