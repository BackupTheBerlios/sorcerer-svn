      desc 'GUI for controlling IEEE1394 bus digital cameras
(aka FireWire, or iLink).
Coriander is full featured and besides changing the parameters
of the camera it will also let you record video,
send images to an FTP site, convert the video to a V4L stream,...
A live display is of course provided too.
Best of all, coriander will work with any camera that is
compatible with the IIDC specifications (also known as DCAM specs).
This includes most 1394 webcams and a majority of
industrial or scientific cameras too. 
However, any cameras in which you can insert a video tape 
(camcorders,...) will NOT work with coriander.
These cameras record compressed DV video on the tape,
while the IIDC specify uncompressed, on-the-fly video flows.
If you wish to use a camcorder you should have a look at Kino instead.'
