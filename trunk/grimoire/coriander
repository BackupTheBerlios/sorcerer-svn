      DESC="$SPELL is a GUI for controlling IEEE1394 bus digital cameras
(aka FireWire, or iLink). Coriander is full featured and 
besides changing the parameters of the camera it will also 
let you record video, send images to an FTP site, convert 
the video to a V4L stream,... A live display is of course 
provided too. Best of all, Coriander will work with any 
camera that is compatible with the IIDC specifications 
(also known as DCAM specs). This includes most 1394 webcams 
and a majority of industrial or scientific cameras too. 
However, any cameras in which you can insert a video tape 
(camcorders,...) will NOT work with coriander. These cameras 
record compressed DV video on the tape, while the IIDC specify 
uncompressed, on-the-fly video flows. If you wish to use a 
camcorder you should have a look at Kino instead.
