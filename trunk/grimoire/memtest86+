      desc 'tool for testing memory problems
Probably requires that SA to make a lilo entry to run this
during boot instead of a linux kernel.
That modification is not currently automatically supported by Sorcerer,
but could be added as an entry into /etc/lilo.conf.d/tail

This may be obsolete since the linux kernel can also perform
memory tests when given proper command line parameters.
