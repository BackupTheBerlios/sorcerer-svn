      DESC=("A tool for testing x86 memory problems"
"Can be used to generate a listing of bad memory blocks which can be 
given as a boot paramter to the kernel which will allow the kernel to 
sequester the bad memory. Based on the well-known original memtest86
written by Chris Brady, memtest86+ is a port by some members of the 
x86-secret team. Our goal is to provide an up-to-date and completly
reliable version of this software tool aimed at memory failures 
detection.")
