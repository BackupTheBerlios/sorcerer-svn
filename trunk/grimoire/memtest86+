Probably requires that SA to make a lilo entry to run this
during boot instead of a linux kernel.
That modification is not currently automatically supported by Sorcerer,

build(){
make memtest.bin &&
mkdir   -vp                 $DESTDIR/boot/memtest &&
install -vm 644 memtest.bin $DESTDIR/boot/memtest
}
