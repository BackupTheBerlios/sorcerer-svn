      desc 'tool for monitoring the progress of data through a pipe
It provides information about:
data throughput, duration, and estimate until completion.

This would be potentially useful shell utility.
However, since it is hosted at googlecode.com

Consequently, leech will not download the file.
googlecode.com servers are the only servers I recall
