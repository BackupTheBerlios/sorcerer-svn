      DESC='pv is a tool for monitoring the progress of data through a pipe.
It provides information about:
data throughput, duration, and estimate until completion.

This would be potentially useful shell utility.
However, since it is hosted at googlecode.com
the server reports 404 upon a head request
and therefore swears the file does not exist.
Consequently, leech will not download the file.
googlecode.com servers are the only servers I recall
that lie about the content they are hosting.'
