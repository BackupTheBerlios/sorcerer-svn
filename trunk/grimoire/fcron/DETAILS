      DESC="fcron is a superior periodic scheduler.

fcron is a periodical command scheduler which aims at replacing 
vixie cron, so it implements most of its functionality.
It does not assume that your system is 
running either all the time or regularly.
You can, for instance, tell fcron to execute 
tasks every x hours y minutes of system uptime, 
or to do a job only once in a specified interval of time.
You can also set a nice value to a job, run it 
depending on the system load average, and much more."
