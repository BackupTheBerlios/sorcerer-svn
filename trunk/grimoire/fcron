with info    cite 'periodic scheduler
On two boxes fcron has failed to execute crons at specified times.
You may want to consider using mcron instead of fcron.
fcron is a periodical command scheduler which aims at replacing
vixie cron, so it implements most of its functionality.
It does not assume that your system is
running either all the time or regularly.
You can, for instance, tell fcron to execute
tasks every x hours y minutes of system uptime,
or to do a job only once in a specified interval of time.
You can also set a nice value to a job, run it
depending on the system load average, and much more.'
