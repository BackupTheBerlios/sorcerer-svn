Security as its main goal.
It has DoS protection, connection control, and traffic throttling.
It has also been thoroughly checked and tested for buffer overflows.
It has been tested on Linux, FreeBSD, OpenBSD, Mac OS X and Cygwin.
Because of its size (about 60 kB), it will even run on old hardware.
It uses multi-threading instead of forking,
which is a real performance improvement.
It also has SSL support.'
