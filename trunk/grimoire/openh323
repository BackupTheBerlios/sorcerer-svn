# The filename extension on this source is
# src-tar.gz
# sorcery can handle src.tar.gz
# but not src-tar.gz for a filename extension.
# Very first time I have seen someone name a file that way!
# Therefore, using the src.zip instead.
# However the files from the zip are full of carriage returns
# therefore rendering them useless on POSIX.
# Marking this broken for now.
# Maybe the software authors will fix those small problems.
