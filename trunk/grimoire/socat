      desc 'socat is a relay for bidirectional data transfers.
socat is a relay for bidirectional data transfer
between two independent data channels.
Each of these data channels may be a file, pipe, device
(terminal or modem, etc.), socket (Unix, IP4, IP6 - raw, UDP, TCP),
a client for SOCKS4, proxy CONNECT, or SSL, etc.
It provides forking, logging, and dumping, different modes
for interprocess communication, and many more options.
It can be used, for example, as a TCP relay (one-shot or daemon),
as a daemon-based socksifier, as a shell interface to Unix sockets,
as an IP6 relay, for redirecting TCP-oriented programs to a serial line,
or to establish a relatively secure environment (su and chroot)
for running client or server shell scripts with network connections.'
