      DESC="muddleftpd is an efficient, lightweight, and secure FTP server.

muddleftpd is an FTP server designed to overcome 
the need for working as root without limiting the 
access protection and safety of a regular FTP server.

It can operate as a replacement for wu-ftpd, 
or it can operate under a single UID, 
running without any knowledge of the system password file.

Anonymous access is available, and you can create as many guest
accounts as you like with the same or different properties.
