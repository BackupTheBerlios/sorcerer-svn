     SHORT="WindowMaker is an X11 windows manager, similar to NeXTSTEP."
      LONG="
WindowMaker is an X11 window manager 
designed to give additional integration 
support to the GNUstep Desktop Environment.
In every way possible, it reproduces the 
elegant look and feel of the NeXTSTEP[tm] GUI.
It is fast, feature rich, easy to configure, 
and easy to use.
In addition, Window Maker works with 
GNOME and KDE, making it one of the most 
useful and universal window managers available.
