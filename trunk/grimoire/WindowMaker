WindowMaker is an X11 window manager
designed to give additional integration
support to the GNUstep Desktop Environment.
In every way possible, it reproduces the
elegant look and feel of the NeXTSTEP[tm] GUI.
It is fast, feature rich, easy to configure,
and easy to use.
In addition, Window Maker works with
GNOME and KDE, making it one of the most
useful and universal window managers available.'
