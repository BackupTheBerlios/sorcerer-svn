A page fault occurs when a program tries to access to a region of memory
that is currently not available. Catching and handling a page fault is a
useful technique for implementing:

# pageable virtual memory,
# memory-mapped access to persistent databases,
# generational garbage collectors,
# stack overflow handlers,
# distributed shared memory'
