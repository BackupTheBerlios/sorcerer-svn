with info    cite 'library for handling page faults in user mode
A page fault occurs when a process accesses a memory address
where RAM has not yet been mapped.
Handling a page fault is useful for implementing:
pageable virtual memory;
memory-mapped access to persistent databases;
generational garbage collectors;
stack overflow handlers;
distributed shared memory.'
