with info    cite 'makes fractal fingerprint png images based on file content
The image will be different for almost every file 
with even slightly different contents (MD5 checksum).
Visprint uses the IFS fractal generation process,
pioneered by Michael Barnsley.
It is a way to create images which are
self-similar to infinite depths.
In other words, the picture is made
up of smaller versions of itself.'
