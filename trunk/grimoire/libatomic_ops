# The most recent version of this package can be found in the source tree 
# for the Boehm-Demers-Weiser garbage collector (bdwgc) on Sourceforge.
# It should be possible to just extract the libatomic_ops source tree
# and build it independently.
# The versions on this site are no longer being updated.
# Future versions will be identified by bdwgc version numbers. 
# That transition is currently (2008-06-01) incomplete.

# If this library is important I might do as the website hosted by hp suggests.

      desc 'implementations for atomic memory update operations
on a number of architectures
This allows direct use of these in reasonably portable code.
Unlike earlier similar packages, this one explicitly considers
memory barrier semantics, and allows the construction of code
that involves minimum overhead across a variety of architectures.'
