DES="provides a method to restrict user share of resources

/etc/limits
which is provided by shadow
enables the kernel to limit the use of resources
by either specific users or all users
It is generally unnecessary unless a user 
frequently hogs the CPUs or
concurrently opens an unreasonable amount of files."

# MAN=limits

# unfortuantely, recent versions of shadow
# are not installing /usr/share/man/limits.5
# only /usr/share/man/ru/man5/limits.5
