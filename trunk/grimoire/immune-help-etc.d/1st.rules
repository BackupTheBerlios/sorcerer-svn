DES="specifies ownership permissions and symlinks for device nodes
udev provides on demand creation of device nodes in /dev
at boot and when devices are plugged into the box and their
appropriate driver is compiled into the kernel or loaded as a module.

However udev might not create the device node, nor the symbolic links
or they might not have desired mode and permissions.

Rules specified in /etc/udev/rules.d/1st.rules execute are evaluated
first and can cause udev to create and give the ownership and
permission to the node that the SA specifies.

Copying and modifying specific rules
from /etc/udev/rules.d/udev.rules
into /etc/udev/rules.d/1st.rules
is probably easier than writing new rules
when a rule for a device already exists."
