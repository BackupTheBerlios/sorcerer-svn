      desc 'off the record messaging provides:

Encryption
    No one else can read your instant messages.
Authentication
    You are assured the correspondent is who you think it is.
Deniability
    The messages you send do not have digital signatures
that are checkable by a third party.
Anyone can forge messages after a conversation
to make them look like they came from you.
However, during a conversation, your correspondent
is assured the messages he sees are authentic and unmodified. 

Perfect forward secrecy
    If you lose control of your private keys,
no previous conversation is compromised.'
