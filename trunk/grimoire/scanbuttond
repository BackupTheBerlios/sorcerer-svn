      desc 'scanbuttond monitors buttons on a scanner device
Modern scanners usually have several front panel buttons
which are intended to trigger certain actions like copying,
faxing or mailing the scanned document.
Unfortunately, the software which monitors the buttons
and starts the appropriate programs
is in most cases only available for a certain proprietary operating system.
This project is an attempt to create a similar piece of software for Linux
(and probably other Unix-like systems).
This daemon queries the scanner button status several times per second.
If it detects that a button is pressed
then it runs a shell script which the button number
is passed to as a command line argument.
Because scanbuttond is accessing the scanner directly via libusb,
there should be no conflicts with SANE or other scanner drivers:
scanbuttond simply will not touch the scanner hardware
while SANE is using it.
Therefore scanbuttond can be run while scanning.'
