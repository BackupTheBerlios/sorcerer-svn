      DESC="Modern scanners usually have several front panel buttons 
which are intended to trigger certain actions like copying, faxing or mailing
 the scanned document. Unfortunately, the software which monitors the buttons
 and starts the appropriate programs is in most cases only available for a 
certain proprietary operating system. This project is an attempt to create a
 similar piece of software for Linux (and probably other Unix-like systems)
. This daemon queries the scanner button status several times per second.
 If it detects that a button is pressed, it runs a shell script which the 
button number is passed to as a command line argument. Because scanbuttond
 is accessing the scanner directly via libusb, there should be no conflicts
 with SANE or other scanner drivers: scanbuttond simply won't touch the
 scanner hardware while you are using SANE. This means that you can still
 scan even when running scanbuttond."
