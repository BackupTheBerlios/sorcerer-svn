#with elect   on divx is for pre-compiled commercial software?
# divx4linux is no longer available
#with elects on libamrnb and libamrwb can not be done due to patents and permission
# possiblewit elect   on openquicktime, but project ceased development in 2003
#with elect   on cog might be for an OSX audio player for mac
# Uncertain where to get dts or dtsdec library from
# dtsdec appears to be the libdca from videolan
# Uncertain where to obtain source forwit elect   on flite
# Is the libmimic from farisght sufficient for gst-plugins-bad?
# openspc http://membres.multimania.fr/pixels/OpenSPC.html
