      DESC="recode converts files files between c haracter sets and usage.
The recode library converts files
between character sets and usages.
The library recognises or produces
nearly 150 different character sets
and is able to transliterate files
between almost any pair.
When exact transliteration are not possible,
it may get rid of the offending characters
or fall back on approximations.
Most RFC 1345 character sets are supported.
The recode program is a handy front-end to the library."
