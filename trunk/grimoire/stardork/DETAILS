Stardork is a console-based game in which (.)s represent 
stars and are randomly placed on the screen.
(X) represents your space ship, and you move 
it in all directions, including diagonally, 
to position yourself to shoot the goal (@).
You can shoot missiles in all directions.
If you run into a star, you lose power.
If you shoot or run into the goal, you move
up a level, and more random stars are plotted.
This eventually creates a more and more 
complex maze of stars you must navigate 
through to position yourself to shoot the goal.
Beat all 34 levels, and you are a master stardork.
