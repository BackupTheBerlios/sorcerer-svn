      desc 'real-time effects processor with GUI for controlling effects
It is meant to be used as a virtual guitar-fx or studio effects box.
In addition to real-time operation,
it also supports reading from and writing to audio files.
All audio object and effect plugin types provided
by the Ecasound libraries are supported.
This includes ALSA, JACK, OSS, aRts, over 20 file formats,
over 30 effect types, LADSPA plugins, and multi-operator effect presets.
The implementation is based on the Ecasound and Qt libraries.'
