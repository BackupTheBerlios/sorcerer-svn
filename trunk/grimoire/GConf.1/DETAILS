GConf is a system for storing configuration 
information, that is, key-value pairs.
GConf provides a notification service so applications 
can be notified when a key's value is changed.
GConf also allows for pluggable storage mechanisms 
(text files, databases, etc.); allows administrators 
to install default values; and allows application 
authors to document their configuration keys for the 
benefit of administrators.
