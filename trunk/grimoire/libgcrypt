# cryptsetup dynamically links with libgcrypt
# cryptsetup runs from sysinit
# sysinit may run on an initramfs image
# Therefore, libgcrypt must have libraries installed in /lib or /lib64

# version of autotools that comes with libgcrypt version 1.4.5 and 1.4.6
# is buggy and does not choose correct libgpg-error library when linking.
