      DESC="lufs is a hybrid userspace filesystem framework supporting filesystems.
lufs is a hybrid userspace filesystem framework
supporting an indefinite number of filesystems
(localfs, sshfs, ftpfs, httpfs, socketfs,
freenetfs, nutellafs, gvfs, and gnetfs)
transparently for any application.
It can be regarded as doing the same job as the
VFS (virtual filesystem switch) in the kernel:
it is a switch, distributing the filesystem
calls to its supported filesystems.
However, LUFS filesystems are implemented in userspace.
This would be a drawback for local filesystems
where the access speed is important, but proves
to be a huge advantage for networked filesystems
where the userland flexibility is most important."
