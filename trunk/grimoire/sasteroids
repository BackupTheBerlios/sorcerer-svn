      desc 'sasteroids is an asteroids type game.
sasteroids is a rework of the original Sasteroids
game by Brad Pitzel last released in 1994.
It allows the original Sasteroids game to be played on
modern hardware, without vgalib and older versions of gcc.
Old fans of the original will find many suprises in
addition to the same old game released years ago.'
