     desc 'DenyHosts is a script to help thwart ssh server attacks.
If you have ever looked at your ssh log you may be alarmed
to see how many hackers attempted to gain access to your server.
Hopefully, none of them were successful
(but then again, how would you know?).
Would not it be better to automatically prevent that
attacker from continuing to gain entry into your system? 
DenyHosts attempts to address the above... and more.'
