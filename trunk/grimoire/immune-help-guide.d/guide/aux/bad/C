/aux/bad/
/aux/bad/ appears after immune-sentinel-elf
automatically detected and handled
a failure involving a critical ELF library.
/aux/bad/ is safe to remove.
/aux/bad/ is preserved for the SA
to make comparisons and deduce the problem.
If the box appears to be working properly
then immune-sentinel-elf already circumvented the problem
by copying content from /aux/fit/ to /
