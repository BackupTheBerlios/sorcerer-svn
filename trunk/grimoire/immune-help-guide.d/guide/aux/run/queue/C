/aux/run/queue/
This directory contains sub directories for the queues
that are associated with the sorcery utilities.
Typically, an action can not be accomplished immediately.
Perhaps other actions must occur first.
The use of queues allows for an action to be requested
and then accomplished later when possible.
For a more detailed explanation please execute
# augur help queue
