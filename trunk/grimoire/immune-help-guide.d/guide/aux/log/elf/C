ELF logs describe the ELF, Executable Linux Format,
shared object library interdependencies.
If a software project that installs an ELF library
is updated and the SO name for the library changes
then that indicates a break in binary compatibility.
Differences in binary compatibility are fixed
by re-compiling and re-linking installed software
which was linked with the old SO name library.
ELF logs are required in order to quickly identifiy
and mitigate a ripple effect of updating installed software
which provides newer shared object library files.
Using ELF logs the minimal amount of installed software
that must be re-compiled and re-linked
can be identified for a minimal amount of checking.
