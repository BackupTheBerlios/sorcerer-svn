/aux/log/ contains various log files.
The log files represent the state of installed software.
By examining log files sorcery can identify what is installed,
the version of installed software,
the selections made about optionally required software, 
and track the files directories and device nodes that are installed.
If information in log files go missing then sorcery
will not be able to update nor remove installed software.
Therefore, feel invited to look.
However, do not modify or remove files or directories
without knowing the consequence.
