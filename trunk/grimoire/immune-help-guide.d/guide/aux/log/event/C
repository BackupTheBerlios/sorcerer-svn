/aux/log/event/

Event logs are purely informational logs.
At times sorcery will use event logs to enhance
provided information such as being able to provide
estimations of a software project's compilation.
Or an event log can indicate the manifest of installed software
the previous time a software project successfully compiled and installed.
Event logs might be empty, or contain content, or contain gzipped content.
The easiest way to select and view an event log
is probably by executing the command:
# au event-menu

Event logs are periodically pruned when the spell
immune-clean-event recasts.
The version of immune-clean-event changes weekly.
Therefore, the presented event logs can remain a tidy
collection of salient information from 3 years to current.

Removing event logs, some or all, can provide an immediate
gain of inodes and free space on a file system.
However, that is not recommended.
Snap shot logs and old compile logs saved in event logs
can provide useful information.
Manual or more aggressive pruning of event logs might only
be desired on a computer that does full rebuilds nearly monthly.
Otherwise event logs are worth the disk space.
