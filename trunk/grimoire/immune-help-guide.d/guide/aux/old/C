/aux/old/
/aux/old/ provides a holding area for previously installed spells.
/aux/old/ is automatically removed by cast
when three conditions are met:
no spell is casting;
no spell is waiting to cast;
an Miss ELF event is not ongoing.
An Miss ELF event happens when
an ELF library formerly installed by a spell
is not installed by the current version of the spell
and installed software requires
the formerly installed ELF library.

Cast automatically remedies Miss ELF events
by identifying installed software
that requires formerly installed ELF libraries
and recasting the spells that installed the software.
However, if the spells required
for solving the Miss ELF event
fail to cast
then the Miss ELF event
prevents /aux/old/ from being removed.

Do not rm -r /aux/old with first
knowing which spells are causing the Miss ELF event
and knowing which software will fail to run
when the required ELF libraries are no longer available.

Pressing Shift Page Up will scroll upward
