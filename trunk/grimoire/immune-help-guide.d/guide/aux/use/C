/aux/use/
This directory contains modified configuration files.
A configuration file would be moved
from /etc/ to /aux/use/etc/
if the configuration file is modified
and if the spell that claims it is being dispelled.
After the spell is cast,
such as during an upgrade,
then the modified configuration file migrates
from /aux/use/etc/ back into /etc/
/aux/use/ can also be used for saving configuration files
stored in locations other than /etc/
such as configuration files used by KDE.
