/aux/set/rootfs/ provides persistent file system entries for the rootfs

The rootfs is a virtual file system mounted at /
and is populated with content from initramfs images.
The rootfs content is a subset of /+/base/
yet some files must differ such as /etc/hostname
/aux/set/rootfs/etc/hostname
is copied to   /etc/hostname during sysinit.
