/aux/set/ contains a hierarchy of persistent file system entries

A file system entry could be a
directory, file, symbolic link, device node, etc...
Entries within these directories persist
because they are recreated within / on each boot.
Therefore, persistent entries can create files
or file content on /dev/ /proc/ /sys/
which are virtual file systems.
