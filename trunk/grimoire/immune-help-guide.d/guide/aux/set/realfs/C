/aux/set/realfs/ provides persistent file system entries
for a root file system

Root file systems are backed by a block device.
Content of a root file system persists across reboots.
Virtual file systems are backed by swap.
Content is discarded upon reboot or shutdown.

/aux/set/realfs/ provides a location on a real root file system
for storing information that is copied
to virtual file systems during runlevel execution.
For example files in
/aux/set/realfs/sys/fs/cgroup/
are copied to  /sys/fs/cgroup/ during runlevel.
