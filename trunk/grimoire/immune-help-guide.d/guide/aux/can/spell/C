/aux/can/spell/

The command
# augur catalog
downloads spells and stores the spells in /aux/can/spell/
# augur catalog
implicitly runs the command
# augur merge
after updating /aux/can/spell/

The command
# augur merge
combines the contents of /aux/can/spell/
with other directories and tarballs
such as those stored in /usr/share/sorcery/
The merged software catalog goes into /aux/run/tmp/grimoire/

The command
# augur sync
implicitly runs the command
# augur catalog
to update the software catalog
before updating installed software.

If spells are suspected missing from /aux/can/spell/
then a complete software catalog can be gained by running the commands
# rm -fr /aux/can/spell/; augur catalog

Never modify files in /aux/can/spell/
The modification date of the newest file
in /aux/can/spell/ determines when
/aux/can/spell/ was last updated.
Modifying files in /aux/can/spell/
can cause the download of updated spells to be omitted.
Store local grimoire and local spells elsewhere.
The proper location for software catalogs
for locally hosted spells is /usr/local/share/sorcery/
