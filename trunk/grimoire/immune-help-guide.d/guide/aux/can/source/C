/aux/can/source/
The files that are considered sources for spells are stored
within spell specific directories here.
For easy identification and pruning the hierarchy is
/aux/can/$SPELL/$VERSION/
where $SPELL is the name of the spell
and $VERSION is the version of the spell.
Therefore, sources for a spell that are older or newer
than the installed version can be stored within and
be easily identified and utilized even in the rare scenario
where the software author has not properly
included the version within the file name.
