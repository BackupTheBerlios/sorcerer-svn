/var/log/sorcery/queue/ provides queues for processing spells.
The queues directories are like todo lists.
The "augur queue" command is used to fill the queues.
And "augur begin" instructs the tools to begin processing the queues.
When a spell is queued for processing then an empty file
with the same name as the spell
is created in the appropriate processing queue.
