/var/cache/archive/
/var/cache/archive/ provides a hierarchy directory structure
for storing the archive tarball
that are created by cast
when the archive feature is enabled
after a spell successfully casts.

Archive tarballs are located within
/var/cache/archive/$HOSTTYPE/$SPELL/$VERSION/
where $SPELL is the name of the spell
and $VERSION is the version.
Consequently, multiple versions of archives
can be retained for a spell.

If the spell immune-sentinel-space is installed
then archive tarballs
are automatically xz compressed
using idle CPU cycles.
If the spell immune-exam-clean is installed
then files and directories in /var/cache/archive/
are properly pruned weekly.

Pressing Shift Page Up will scroll upward
for reading missed portions of the directory description.
