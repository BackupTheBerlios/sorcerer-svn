/var/cache/ccache/
/var/cache/ccache/ provides a directory
for storing the tarballs of ccache generated files
that are used when casting spells.

Ccache tarballs are named
/var/cache/ccache/$SPELL.tar or
/var/cache/ccache/$SPELL.tar.xz
where $SPELL is the name of the spell

If the spell immune-sentinel-space is installed
then ccache tarballs
are automatically xz compressed
using idle CPU cycles.

If the spell immune-exam-clean is installed
then files and directories in /var/cache/ccache/
are properly pruned weekly.

Pressing Shift Page Up will scroll upward
for reading missed portions of the directory description.
