/var/cache/sources/
/var/cache/sources/ provides a hierarchy directory structure
for storing the    source files required for casting spells.
Source tarballs or source files are located within
/var/cache/sources/$SPELL/$VERSION/
where $SPELL is the name of the spell
and $VERSION is the version.
Consequently, multiple versions of source files
can be retained for a spell.

If the spell immune-sentinel-space is installed
then source tarballs
are automatically xz compressed
using idle CPU cycles.

If the spell immune-exam-clean is installed
then files and directories in /var/cache/sources/
are properly pruned weekly.

Pressing Shift Page Up will scroll upward
for reading missed portions of the directory description.
