/etc/init.d/ contains init-scripts.
They control the programs that a box runs
when booting and shutting down.
For more information please execute ./README

init-scripts are not configuration files.
Therefore, a customized init-script will not
survive the update of installed software which
originally installed the init-script.

Configuration files for init-scripts
are mostly stored in /etc/init.d/conf.d/
