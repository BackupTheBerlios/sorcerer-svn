/etc/init.d/conf.d/ contains configuration files for init-scripts.
A configuration file for an init-script will have
the same file name as the init-script.
Additionally, many init-scripts can be run with the
"configure" parameter in order to receive a menu drive method
for modifying the init-script's configuration file.
