/bin/ contains executable files that are invoked by everyone.
/bin/ is always included in the PATH
Therefore, anyone can invoke files in /bin/
by merely typing their name
instead of prefixing a relative or absolute path name.

This directory is included on the initramfs
and therefore can be accessed during sysinit
and when logged onto the Sorcerer's keep.
The Sorcerer's keep can be accessed by
logging in on virtual console #7 or by
executing ssh -p 30 127.0.0.1
