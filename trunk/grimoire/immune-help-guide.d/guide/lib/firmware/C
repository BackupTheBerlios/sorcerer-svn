/lib/firmware/ contains firmware for devices that is loaded
when required by a linux kernel module.

This directory is included on the initramfs
and therefore can be accessed during sysinit
and when logged onto the Sorcerer's keep.
The Sorcerer's keep can be accessed by
logging in on virtual console #7 or by
executing ssh -p 30 127.0.0.1
