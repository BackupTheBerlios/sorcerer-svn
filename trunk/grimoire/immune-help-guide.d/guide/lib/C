/lib is the 32-bit library directory.
Additional directory descriptions are provided only for
/lib/firmware/ and /lib/modules/

This directory is included on the initramfs
and therefore can be accessed during sysinit
and when logged onto the Sorcerer's keep.
The Sorcerer's keep can be accessed by
logging in on virtual console #7 or by
executing ssh -p 30 127.0.0.1
