/root/.sorcery/ is a tmpfs file system provided for storing
the generated data used by the sorcery tools when invoked by root.
tmpfs provides faster generation and access to the files
while the content remains swappable in order to free RAM
when competition for RAM becomes intense.
Files on tmpfs do not survive reboot,
however none of /root/.sorcery/ contents
is intended to survive reboot.
