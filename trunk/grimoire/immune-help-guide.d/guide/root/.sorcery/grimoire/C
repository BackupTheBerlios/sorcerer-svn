/root/.sorcery/grimoire/ is the merged grimoire.
grimoire is a fancy word for for book written in Latin.
After a sorcery provided tool is invoked
with instructions that require spells
then the merged grimoire fills with spell files and directories.
Spells provide a terse human readable format
that the tools use in order to discover
how to download, compile, and install software projects.
If sorcery was a junior SA
then spells would provide a succinct method
for explaining the method for accomplishing a task.
