/usr/libexec/sorcery/
This is the directory where the sorcery tools actually exist.
They are sourced in by tiny wrappers provided in /usr/sbin/
This is a necessary precaution to avoiding a bug in BASH.
None of the files in these directories should be modified by the SA.
SA modifications can be made in /etc/sorcery/local.config
to override functions defined in the sorcery tools.
Variables that effect sorcery tools are also stored in
/etc/sorcery/local.config
