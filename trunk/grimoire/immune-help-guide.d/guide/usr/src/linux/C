/usr/src/linux/ is the directory that contains
a configured and compiled linux kernel source.
All sources are discarded after compilation, except linux.
That is because software projects that provide modules
may also require a configured compiled linux source tree
in order to generate the module.
The linux source is interesting reading,
however the human readable documentation is mostly contained in
/usr/src/linux/Documentation/
/usr/src/linux/Documentation/ is definitely worth a visit.
