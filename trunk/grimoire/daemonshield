# It installs it's configuraiton file in /usr/etc
# If it's install location is changed to /etc
# then it can not find it's configuration file
# unless I also modify it's Python script.
# It installs it's own non LSB compliant init script.
# I'll fix this spell if anyone wants to use it.
# but it appears to be a Python script that can 
# only woefully handle the task it is designed for.
# It should have been written in C and not an interpreted language.

      DESC="daemonshield is a linux intrusion and prevention daemon.
It scans for brute force break-in attacks in real time.
It uses iptables to create rules that block the attackers'
IP addresses for a configurable period of time.
It uses handlers that watch for attacks against
given services, such as SSH, telnet, FTP, etc.
It is highly configurable through a central configuration file.
It loads existing blocklist rules into iptables on startup,
and removes the blocklist rules when it shuts down.
Other major features include background daemon operation,
logging to syslog, easy-to-extend handlers,
configurable block duration, and email notifications."
