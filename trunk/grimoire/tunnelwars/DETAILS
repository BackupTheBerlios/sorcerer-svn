cat << EOF
This is multi-player action game.
It is inspired by old MS-DOS game tunnellers.
Each player has armored combat vehicle with broad selection
of weapons and should use it to destroy opponent's vehicle.
But things aren't so simple ... combat is often situated deep 
in the earth or at another place filled with dirt, ice or 
another impermeable material so that vehicles have to dig tunnels.
