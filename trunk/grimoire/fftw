      DESC="fftw is the fast fourier tranform C library.
fftw, is the is a fast fourier transfer C library.
It includes complex, real, and parallel transforms,
and can handle arbitrary array sizes efficiently.
FFTW is typically faster than other publically-available FFT
implementations, and is even competitive with vendor-tuned
libraries (benchmarks are available at the homepage).
To achieve this performance, FFTW uses novel code-generation and
runtime self-optimization techniques (along with many other tricks)."


# build_old creates libraries named with a f before the .so
# /usr/lib/libfftw3f.so.3.1.2
# sources such as libofa want fftw libraries named such as:
# /usr/lib/libfftw3.so.3.1.2
# If this old build_old is used then libofa will not compile.
