      desc 'fast fourier tranform C library
fftw, is the is a fast fourier transfer C library.
It includes complex, real, and parallel transforms,
and can handle arbitrary array sizes efficiently.
FFTW is typically faster than other publically-available FFT
implementations, and is even competitive with vendor-tuned
libraries (benchmarks are available at the homepage).
To achieve this performance, FFTW uses novel code-generation and
runtime self-optimization techniques (along with many other tricks).'
