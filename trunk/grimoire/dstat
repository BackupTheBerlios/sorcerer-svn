Dstat is a versatile replacement for vmstat, iostat and ifstat.
Dstat overcomes some of the limitations and adds some extra features.
Dstat allows you to view all of your system resources
instantly, you can eg. compare disk usage in combination
with interrupts from your IDE controller, or compare the
network bandwidth numbers directly with the disk throughput
(in the same interval).'
