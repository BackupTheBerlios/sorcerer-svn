grsecurity is a complete security system for Linux 2.4 that 
implements a detection/prevention/containment strategy.
It prevents most forms of address space modification, 
confines programs with least privilege via its 
process-based MAC system, hardens syscalls, 
provides full-featured auditing, and implements 
many of the OpenBSD randomness features.
It was written for performance, ease-of-use, and security.
The MAC system has an intelligent learning-mode, 
and all of grsecurity supports a feature that logs 
the IP of the attacker that causes an alert or audit.
