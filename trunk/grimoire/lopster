      DESC="lopster is a gtk+ napster client.
Napster is a protocol for sharing MP3 files between users.
With Napster, the files stay on the client machine, 
never passing through the server.
The server provides the ability to search 
for particular files and initiate a 
direct transfer between the clients.
In addition, chat forums similar to IRC are available."
