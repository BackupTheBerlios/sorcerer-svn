      desc 'mondo-daemon is a system health monitor daemon.

mondo-daemon is a very simplistic health
monitoring daemon that relies on lm_sensors.
It is capable of monitoring whatever settings youu are
willing to assign a label to in your sensors.conf file.
Its real power is to automatically take action when an alarm
is tripped--i.e. e-mail someone, perform a quick power-off,
or the like. Mondo can track a lower threshold and an upper
threshold for each sensor feature in the system, and it can
execute a specific command for each threshold.  
If a fan fails, or a component approaches a temperature where
it could damage itself, chances are mondo can sense this
automatically and take immediate action.
---
After installation run $ mondo-setup or edit /etc/mondo.conf manually.'
