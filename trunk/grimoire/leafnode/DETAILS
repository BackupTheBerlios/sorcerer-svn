Leafnode is a news server, suitable for small, limited-bandwidth
sites with only a few users (and useful for offline news reading).
Leafnode keeps track of which groups are being read and downloads
only articles in those groups.  Leafnode has been designed to require
no maintenance and to be easy to set up.
