      desc 'an interactive physical simulator
It allows exploration of the physical world through simulations.
It works like this: place some bodies on the scene,
add some forces such as gravity or springs, then click Simulate and
step shows you how the scene will evolve according to the laws of physics.
Every property of the bodies/forces in the experiment can be changed,
even during simulation, to see how the change will evolve.'
