with info    cite 'RADIUS authenticaton, accounting and logging server

freeradius is a high-performance and highly configurable RADIUS server.
While the server is conceptually similar to the Livingston server
variants, it has many more features, and is much more configurable.
It includes plug-in modules with support for:  MySQL, PostgreSQL,
Oracle, IODBC, IBM DB2, MS-SQL, Sybase, LDAP, Kerberos, EAP, PAM,
MS-CHAP and MPPE, Digest authentication, Python, X9.9, and many more.
It allows the administrator to fully customize the
behaviour of authentication, accounting, and logging.'
