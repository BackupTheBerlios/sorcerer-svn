Digger was originally created by Windmill software 
in 1983 and released as a copy-protected, bootable 
5.25" floppy disk for the IBM PC.
As it requires a genuine CGA card, it didn't work on modern PCs.

In 1998, I created Digger Remastered, which runs on all 
PCs with CGA or better and plays just like the original.
It also has many new features, including:

    * Exit button
    * Optional VGA graphics
    * Recording and playback
    * Real time speed control
    * Keyboard redefinition
    * Gauntlet mode
    * Two player simultaneous mode
