      DESC="rlog provides a message logging facility for C++ programs and libraries.
It is subscription based, meaning you can subscribe to
messages of your choice in an number of ways: by hierarchical channel
name (e.g. debug, debug, special, error, etc.), or filename,
component name, etc. Log messages are individually enabled.
It is meant to be fast enough to leave in production code -
even where it may be called many times, as both the GCC and
Intel compilers reduce the logging overhead a few clock cycles
if they are dormant (with no subscribers).
Other add-on components can extend subscriptions to external programs,
allowing you to enable and collect debugging messages remotely."
