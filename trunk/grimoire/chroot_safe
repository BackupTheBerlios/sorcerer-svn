      desc 'alternative method for chrooting
It delays the chrooting until after dynamic linking has completed, 
thereby eleminating the need to have a copy of the binary or 
libraries within the chroot.
This greatly simplifies the process of chrooting an application,
as often only data files are needed within the chroot.
In addition to chrooting the application,
it also drops root privileges
before allowing the application to start.'
