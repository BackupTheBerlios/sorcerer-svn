      DESC="chroot_safe is a alternative method for chrooting.
It delays the chrooting until after dynamic linking has completed, 
thereby eleminating the need to have a copy of the binary or 
libraries within the chroot.
This greatly simplifies the process of chrooting an application,
as you often do not need any files besides the data files within
the chroot.
In addition to chrooting the application, it also drops 
root privileges before allowing the application to start."
