cronolog is a simple filter program that reads log file 
entries from standard input and writes each entry to 
the output file specified by a filename template and 
the current date and time. When the expanded filename 
changes, the current file is closed and a new one opened. 
cronolog is intended to be used in conjunction with a 
Web server, such as Apache, to split the access log 
into daily or monthly logs.'
