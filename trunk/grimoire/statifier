      desc 'creates static executables from dynamic executables and libraries
Executable files may be linked statically or dynamically.
Dynamically linked executables use less disk space and memory,
but require appropriative dynamic libraries present in order to run.
ELF statifier make one executable file with no run-time dependencies
from a dynamically linked executable and all its libraries.
This file can be copied and run on another machine
with no need for all of the libraries.'
