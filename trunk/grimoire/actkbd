      DESC="actkbd is a simple daemon that binds actions to keyboard events.
It recognises key combinations and can handle press,
repeat and release events.
Currently it only supports the linux-2.6 evdev interface,
but the platform-specific code is well-contained,
so that support for additional platforms can be added
with no or minimal changes to the rest of the code."
