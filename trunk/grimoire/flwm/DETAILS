flwm is an X window manager designed to be user friendly 
and use the absolute minimum amount of screen real estate.
It has no icons, using a pop-up menu to select 
hidden or new windows, and sideways titlebars. 
Flwm is also designed to achieve Gnome, KDE, and Motif 
compatibility simultaneously and has also been tested 
with many SGI programs that normally require 4DWM.
