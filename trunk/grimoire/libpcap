with info    cite 'packet capturing library. used by tcpdump
libpcap is a library which provides a packet
filtering mechanism based on the BSD packet filter (BPF).
Most notably, tcpdump needs this to work,
and there is also a perl module which can use this as well.
In plain english, if you want to write your own
network traffic analyzer, this is the place to start.'
