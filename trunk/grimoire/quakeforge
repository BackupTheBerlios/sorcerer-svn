This game requires data files.
ID games sells the original quake game.
The cost is $10 US dollars to download.

Shareware quake:
http://www.quakeforge.net/files/quake-shareware-1.06.tar.gz

There is a project to create free game data,
but it has not been updated in a while.
The quality may be suspect.
http://sourceforge.net/projects/openquartz/

Copy id1 from the game data to 
/usr/share/games/quakeforge, resulting in: 
/usr/share/games/quakeforge/id1

Make all filenames in the id1 directory lower case.'
