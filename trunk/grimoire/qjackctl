      DESC="$SPELL controls the jack sound server daemon
$SPELL provides a simple GUI dialog for setting
several JACK daemon parameters, which are properly
saved between sessions, and a way to control the
status of the audio server daemon. With time, this 
primordial interface has become richer by including 
a enhanced patchbay and connection control features."
