with info    cite 'GUI dialog for the jack sound server daemon
qjackctl provides a simple GUI dialog for setting
several JACK daemon parameters, which are properly
saved between sessions, and a way to control the
status of the audio server daemon.
With time, this primordial interface has become richer by
including a enhanced patchbay and connection control features.'
