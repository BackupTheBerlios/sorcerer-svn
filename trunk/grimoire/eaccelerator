      DESC="eAccelerator is a free open-source PHP accelerator, optimizer, and dynamic content cache.
It increases the performance of PHP scripts by caching them
in their compiled state, so that the overhead of compiling is
almost completely eliminated. It also optimizes scripts to speed
up their execution. eAccelerator typically reduces server load
and increases the speed of your PHP code by 1-10 times."
