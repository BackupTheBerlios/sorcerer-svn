It increases the performance of PHP scripts by caching them in their compiled state,
so that the overhead of compiling is almost completely eliminated.
It also optimizes scripts to speed up their execution.
eAccelerator typically reduces server load and
increases the speed of your PHP code by 1-10 times.'
