with info    cite 'daemon for monitoring networked hosts and services
It has the ability to notify contacts
(via email, pager or other methods)
when problems arise and are resolved.
Host and service checks are performed by external plugins,
making it easy to write custom checks.
Several CGIs are included for viewing the current
and historical status via a Web browser,
and a WAP interface is also provided
to acknowlege problems and disable
notifications from an internet-ready cellphone.'
