To use the dynamic features of GOK, such as the Menus and Toolbars
keyboards, you will need to run an application that is compatible
with the GNOME 2 accessibility features, such as GNOME 2 applications.
Please also set the GNOME accessibility GConf key:

$ gconftool-2 -s /desktop/gnome/interface/accessibility -t bool true

GOK has a keyboard editor that can be used to
create new keyboards and modify existing ones.
The keyboard editor is started by running GOK as follows:

$ gok --editor'
