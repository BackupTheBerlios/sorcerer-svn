gok provides the gnome on-screen keyboard.

To use the dynamic features of GOK, such as the Menus and Toolbars
keyboards, you will need to run an application that is compatible with
the GNOME 2 accessibility features, such as GNOME 2 applications.
Please also set the GNOME accessibility GConf key:

$ gconftool-2 -s /desktop/gnome/interface/accessibility -t bool true

GOK has a keyboard editor that can be used to create new keyboards and
modify existing ones.  The keyboard editor is started by running GOK
as follows:

$ gok --editor
"
