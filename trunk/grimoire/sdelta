      DESC="sdelta is a dictionary compressor.
sdelta identifies and reports the changes between two files.
The report can be saved into a compressed
file and transferred to another box.
Finally, sdelta can combine the report and
first file to generate the second file.

sdelta's primary use is to reduce
the amount of bytes transferred
when source upgrades are downloaded.

sdelta must be installed and the sdelta
feature enabled within sorcery for
Sorcerer boxes to request and download
source upgrade patches."
