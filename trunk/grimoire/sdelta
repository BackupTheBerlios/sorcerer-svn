      DESC="sdelta is a dictionary compressor.
sdelta is similar to xdelta.
Both are designed to identify and report the changes between two files.
The report can be saved into a bzip2 compressed file.
Finally, the sdelta and first file can 
be combined to generate the second file.

sdelta's primary use is to reduce the 
amount of bytes transferred when either
new sources or source upgrades are downloaded.

cast sdelta and enable the sdelta feature 
and source upgrade patches will be generated 
automatically for Sorcerer boxes.

sdelta's algorithm is honed to the characteristics of text files.
sdelta generates smaller compressed delta 
files for source tarballs than xdelta can.
However for deltas of binary files xdelta is still the king."
