$SHORT
The input is a portable bitmap (PBM), 
and the default output is an encapsulated PostScript file (EPS).
A typical use is to create EPS files from scanned data, 
such as company or university logos, handwritten notes, etc.
The resulting image is not "jaggy" like a bitmap, but smooth.
It can then be rendered at any resolution.EOF
