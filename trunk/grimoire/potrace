      desc 'utility for transforming a bitmap into a smooth, scalable image
The input is a portable bitmap (PBM),
and the default output is an encapsulated PostScript file (EPS).
A typical use is to create EPS files from scanned data,
such as company or university logos, handwritten notes, etc.
The resulting image is not jaggy like a bitmap, but smooth.
It can then be rendered at any resolution.'
