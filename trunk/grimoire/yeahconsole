      DESC="yeahconsole provides xterm at top of screen similar to game console.
Yeahconsole puts an xterm window on top of your screen that
behaves like the console found in many games (similar to kuake).
Its visibility can be toggled by a keyboard shortcut.

It may require yeahwm, because it crashes with evilwm."
