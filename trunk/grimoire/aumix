with info    cite 'audio volume adjustment mixer program
It can run under X with GTK+, in full-screen text
mode with ncurses and (if available) gpm, or
non-interactively, and can store all settings in a file.

It works with the OSS API.
If not loading the compatibility modules
then consider installing alsa-utils
and using alsamixer instead of aumix.'
