      desc 'mhash is a free library for hash algorithms
mhash is a thread-safe hash library implemented in C,
and provides a uniform interface to a large number of
hash algorithms (MD5, SHA-1, HAVAL, RIPEMD160, TIGER, GOST).
These algorithms can be used to compute
checksums, message digests, and other signatures.
The HMAC support implements the basics for message
authentication, following RFC 2104.'
