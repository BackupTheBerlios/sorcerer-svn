with info    cite "pressing CapsLock forces sysinit to continue
30s after sysinit begins this functionality becomes active.
If the person at the keyboard expects that sysinit stalled
then pressing CapsLock kills running init-scripts.
This allows booting to continue
or perhaps entirely derails the boot process.
Therefore, please use cautiously."
