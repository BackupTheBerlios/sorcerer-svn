      desc 'file-manager for X
worker is a file-manager exclusive for X based on the
famous filemanager DirectoryOpus on the AmigaOS.
It is configurable on the fly without restarting Worker.
Any external program can be easily integrated
in the GUI, including a button and a hotkey.
Worker uses real file-recognition on file-content or
filename extention where each file-type can get an own action.'
