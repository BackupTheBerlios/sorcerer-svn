According to http://www.ece.uvic.ca/~mdadams/jasper/software/

***
Everything is automatically installed in the 
/usr/local/bin and /usr/local/share/gyach/ directories.
There is NO need to type 'configure' before building,
and there is currently no way to change the installation directory.
Icons for the program are available in the 
/usr/local/share/gyach/pixmaps/ directory.
***

However since distributions do not install software into /usr/local/
This spell will not be completed until/unless the software author
decides that the installation location should not be fixed to
/usr/local

For webcam try gyachi and for audio chat try gyach.
There is no compelling reason to use gyach-enhanced_pyvoice."
