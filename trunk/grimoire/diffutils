diffutils - Finds differences between and among files

diff outputs the difference between two files in any of several formats.
If the files are identical
then it normally produces no ouput.
If the files are binary (non-text)
it reports only that they are different.

cmp shows the offsets and files numbers where two files differ
 it can also show, side by side, all the characters that
 differ between the two files.

sdif merges two files interactively.

diff3 shows differences among three files.
 If two people make independent changes to a common original
 then diff3 reports difference between the original
 and the two changed versions,
 and can produce a merged file that contains both changes
 along with warnings about conflicts.'
