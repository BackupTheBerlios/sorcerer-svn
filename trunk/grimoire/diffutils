diffutils - Finds differences between and among files

diff outputs the difference between two files in any of several
 formats.  If the files are identical, it normally produces
 no ouput; if they are binary (non-text) it normally reports
 only that they are different.

cmp shows the offsets and files numbers where two files differ
 it can also show, side by side, all the characters that
 differ between the two files.

sdif merges two files interactively.

diff3 shows differences among three files.  If two people have made
 independent changes to a common original, diff3 reports that
 difference between the original and the two changed versions,
 and can produce a merged file that contains both persons'
 changes along with warnings about conflicts."
