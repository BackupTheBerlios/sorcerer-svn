Gtk+Licq is a fully featured gui-plugin for Licq.  It started out as
almost identical to the Qt-gui with a few extensions, but today we have
evolved and are not just a QT-gui clone.  The goal for this project was
to create a usable gtk-gui for Licq, then enhance it.  To run Licq with
the gtk-gui just type 'licq -p gtk_gui'
