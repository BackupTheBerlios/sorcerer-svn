      desc 'krypt provides access to volumes encrypted with LUKS
Krypt is a KDE application that sits in the tray,
and provides easy access to the list of volumes 
encrypted with LUKS, that are present in the system.
It is possible to quickly decrypt, encrypt back,
mount and umount such devices. It also monitors
HAL activity and responds by showing a pop-up
with password prompt.'
