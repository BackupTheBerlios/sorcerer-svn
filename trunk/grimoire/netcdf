      desc 'library for NetCDF data format
(network Common Data Form) which is an interface
for array-oriented data access.
netcdf provides a library of an implementation of the interface.
The netCDF library also defines a machine-independent format
for representing scientific data.
Together, the interface, library, and format support the creation,
access, and sharing of scientific data.
Netcdf version 4 provides compatibility with existing netCDF programs
and data, additional data modeling abstractions,
and features for use in high performance computing,
such as parallel I/O.
Support for an enhanced data model is made possible
by including the capability to use HDF5 as the data storage layer
for the netCDF API.'
