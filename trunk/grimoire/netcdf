       DESC="netcdf is a library for NetCDF data format
(network Common Data Form) which is an interface for 
array-oriented data access. netcdf provides a library of 
an implementation of the interface. The netCDF library 
also defines a machine-independent format for representing 
scientific data. Together, the interface, library, and 
format support the creation, access, and sharing of 
scientific data. Netcdf version 4 provides compatibility 
with existing netCDF programs and data, additional data 
modeling abstractions, and features for use in high 
performance computing, such as parallel I/O. Support 
for an enhanced data model is made possible by including 
the capability to use HDF5 as the data storage layer for 
the netCDF API.
