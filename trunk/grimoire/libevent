      DESC="libevent is a library for providing a callback function when an event occurs.
libevent API provides a mechanism to execute
a callback function when a specific event occurs
on a file descriptor or after a timeout has been reached.
It is meant to replace the asynchronous event
loop found in event-driven network servers."
