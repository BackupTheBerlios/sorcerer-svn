      desc 'libevent is a library for providing a callback function when an event occurs.
libevent API provides a mechanism to execute
a callback function when a specific event occurs
on a file descriptor or after a timeout has been reached.
It is meant to replace the asynchronous event
loop found in event-driven network servers.'

# Needed in /lib/ or /lib64/ so that /sbin/rpc.idmapd can start
# do not bother, rpcidmapd also requires libnfsidmap
# and that also requires openldap
# too much junk in /lib
# moving start of rpc.idmapd to runlevel.
