      DESC="joe is an ASCII text editor.
joe has the feel of most IBM PC text editors:
The key-sequences are reminiscent of WordStar and Turbo-C.
JOE is much more powerful than those editors, however.
JOE has all of the features a UNIX user should expect:
full use of termcap/terminfo, excellent screen update
optimizations, simple installation, and all of the
UNIX-integration features of VI."
