PrBoom is a game engine - it provides a program to play Doom levels, 
but it doesn't include any levels itself.  More importantly, you need
all the sounds, sprites, and other graphics that make up the Doom
environment.   So to play PrBoom, you need one of the main Doom date
files from id  Software - either doom.wad, doom2.wad, tnt.wad or
plutonia.wad from one of the commercial Doom games, or the shareware
doom1.wad.  This file is called the IWAD.
