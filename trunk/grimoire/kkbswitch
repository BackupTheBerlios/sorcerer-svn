      DESC='kkbswitch is a a keyboard layout indicator for KDE.
It is useful when you have configured the XKeyboard
extension of your X Server to have more than one
keyboard group, for example US/ASCII and Russian.
It displays an icon in the system tray that
indicates which layout is currently active.
Note that it does not help you configure XKeyboard,
it merely serves as the indicator of the current group.
You still have to configure XKeyboard by editing the XF86Config file.
You can switch keyboard groups by clicking the icon
or selecting the desired group from the icon menu.
Icons corresponding to different groups are configurable
(chosen from the country flag pixmaps that ship with KDE).
There is also a Toggle mode
(toggles between the two most recently used layouts).
The keyboard layout can be switched for each
window separately (as in Windows) or globally.'
