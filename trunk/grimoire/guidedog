      desc 'advanced routing/network configuration utility 
for KDE 3 running on Linux 2.4 based machines.
Using guidedog you can easily activate packet routing/forwarding
and also more advanced networking such as IP masquerade
and Port Forwarding.
guidedog is intended to work along side any iptables based firewall,
and as such compliments guarddog nicely.
The goals for guidedog are:

* Routing support (i.e. turning on IP forwarding/routing).
* IP masquerade.
* Activating of NAT modules for FTP and IRC.
* Port Forwarding'
