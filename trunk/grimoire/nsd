      DESC='nsd is an authoritative only name server.
Authoritative only name server means that it will only
provide name to IP addresses for the zones it is
supposed to serve and not do recursive lookup of
names that other servers are the authority for.'

# Removed the following from the nsd startup init-script
# is it important? The cp followed b y mount command looks incorrect.

#    mkdir  -p      -m 0700   $JAIL/dev
#    cp     -a      /dev/log  $JAIL/dev/log  2>/dev/null
#    mount  --bind  /dev/log  $JAIL/dev/log
