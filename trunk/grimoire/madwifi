      DESC="Multiband Atheros Driver for Wireless Fidelity.
 In other words: it is a Linux kernel device driver for Atheros-based Wireless 
LAN devices. The driver works such that your WLAN card will appear as a 
normal network interface in the system. Additionally there is support for the
 Wireless Extensions API. This allows you to configure most aspects of the
 device using common wireless tools (ifconfig, iwconfig and friends)."
