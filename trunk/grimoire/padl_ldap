LDAP stands for Lightweight Directory Access Protocol.
LDAP servers are similar to database servers.
However LDAP servers are optimized for reading, browsing, and searching.
Consequently, they lack more complex features of database servers.
And that is why they are called "LightWeight."

Information such as users, groups, and passwords that
are normally stored locally on each box
can be provided by a single or multiple LDAP server.
However, glibc, Linux-PAM and openldap are not automatically integrated.
Fortuantely, PADL provides tools for integrating the three.
This profile is to ease the installation of those tools.

Note that mere installation of the tools
will not configure a box
to act as a ldap server or client.
Several files will require editing.
Several programs will require running.
Below is a URL to a HTML page tutorial that may help demystify the process:
