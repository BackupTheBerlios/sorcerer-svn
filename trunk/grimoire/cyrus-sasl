cyrus-sasl is a generic library for easy integration of secure 
network authentication to any client or server application.
It supports authentication via standard plaintext methods 
as well as CRAM-MD5 and DIGEST-MD5 shared secret methods 
and KERBEROS_V4 and GSSAPI Kerberos methods.
The SASL protocol framework is used by SMTP, IMAP, 
ACAP, LDAP, and other standard protocols.'
