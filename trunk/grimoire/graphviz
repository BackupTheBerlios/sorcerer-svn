graphviz is a set of graph drawing tools and libraries.
It supports hierarchical and mass-spring drawings; 
although the tools are scalable, their emphasis is 
on making very good drawings of reasonably-sized graphs.
Package components include batch layout filters and 
interactive editors for X11, Java, and a TCL/tk extension.
The batch filters can be configured as a web 
visualization service (using GIF and click-maps).
A generic ActiveX client-server component is a 
recent addition to this package.
