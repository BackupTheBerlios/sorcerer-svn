      desc 'pager/text-based WWW browser

w3m is a pager/text-based WWW browser.
It is similar to Lynx, but has several features Lynx does not have.
It can render tables, frames (by converting frames into tables), 
display a document given from standard input, be navigated by mouse 
in an xterm or in a gpm driven console, and it is small.'
