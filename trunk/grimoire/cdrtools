cdrtools, formerly Cdrecord creates home 
burned CDs with a CD-R/CD-RW recorder.
It works as a burn engine for several applications.
Cdrecord supports CD recorders from many different vendors; 
all SCSI-3/mmc and ATAPI/mmc compliant drives should also work.  
Supported features include IDE/ATAPI, parallel-port, 
and SCSI drives, audio CDs, data CDs, and mixed CDs, 
full multi-session support, CD-RWs (rewritable), TAO, 
DAO and human-readable error messages.
Cdrecord includes remote SCSI support and 
can access local or remote CD-writers.
