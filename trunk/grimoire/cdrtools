      desc 'utility for burning CDs with a CD-R/CD-RW recorder
Cdrecord supports CD recorders from many different vendors;
all SCSI-3/mmc and ATAPI/mmc compliant drives should also work.
Supported features include IDE/ATAPI, parallel-port,
and SCSI drives, audio CDs, data CDs, and mixed CDs,
full multi-session support, CD-RWs (rewritable), TAO,
DAO and human-readable error messages.
Cdrecord includes remote SCSI support and
can access local or remote CD-writers.

To burn on IDE cdrecords a typical dev parameter might be
dev=ATAPI:/dev/hdf
Running cdrecord using ide-scsi emulation is no longer recommended.'
