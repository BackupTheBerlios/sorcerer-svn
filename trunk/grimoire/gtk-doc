      desc 'DocBook documentation generator, may cause some sources to fail compilation
gtk-doc may cause some spells to fail during compilation!
GTK-Doc is used to document C code.
It is typically used to document the public API of
libraries, such as the GTK+ and Gnome libraries.
But it can also be used to document application code.'
