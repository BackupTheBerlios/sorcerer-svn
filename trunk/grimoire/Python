      DESC="Python is an interpreted, interactive, object-oriented programming language.

Python is an interpreted, interactive, 
object-oriented programming language.
It combines remarkable power with very 
clear syntax, and isn't difficult to learn.
It has modules, classes, exceptions, very
high level data types, and dynamic typing.
There are interfaces to many system calls 
and libraries, as well as to various 
windowing systems  
(Tk, Mac, MFC, GTK+, Qt, wxWindows).
Newbuilt-in modules are easily written in C or C++.
Python is also usable as an extension language for 
applications that need a programmable interface.
