      desc 'cb2bib extracts bibliography references from unformatted text.
The cb2Bib reads the clipboard text contents and
process it against a set of predefined patterns.
If this automatic detection is successful
then cb2Bib formats the clipboard data according
to the structured BibTeX reference standard.
Otherwise, if no predefined format pattern is found or
if detection proves to be difficult
then manual data extraction is greatly simplified by cb2Bib.
In most cases, such manual data extraction will provide
with a new, personalized pattern to be included within
the predefined pattern set for future automatic extractions.
Once the bibliographic reference is correctly extracted
it is added to a specified BibTeX database file.
Optionally, article PDF files, if available,
are renamed to its citeID and moved to
a desired directory as a personal article library.'
