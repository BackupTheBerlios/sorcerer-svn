      desc 'kdrill helps people learn Japanese Kanji characters.
It originally started as a simple multiple choice
Kanji quiz program, to help people learn Japanese characters,
but it now has a few different guess formats, history options,
and also has a dictionary function.
Words can be looked up in a variety of methods,
including Romaji, SKIP, four-corner, cut-n-paste,
radical lookup, and English search.'
