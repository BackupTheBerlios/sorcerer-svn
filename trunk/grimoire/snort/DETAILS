      DESC="snort is a lightweight network intrustion detection program.

snort is a lightweight network intrusion detection system, 
capable of performing real-time traffic analysis and packet 
logging on IP networks.
It can perform protocol analysis, content searching/matching 
and can be used to detect a variety of attacks and probes, 
such as buffer overflows, stealth port scans, CGI attacks, 
SMB probes, OS fingerprinting attempts, and much more.
Snort uses a flexible rule based language to describe traffic 
that it should collect or pass, and a modular detection engine.
Snort has a real-time alerting capability, with alert mechanisms 
for syslog, a user specified file, a UNIX socket, or WinPopup 
messages to Windows clients using Samba's smbclient.
