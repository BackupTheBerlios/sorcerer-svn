# While snort does not host normal download URLS
# snort will not be supported in the Sorcerer grimoire.


# http://www.snort.org/vrt/
# only way to obtain rules for current version of snort are:
# 1. subscribe and pay
# 2. register
# Do not expect this spell to improve
# until snort.org allows current rules to be downloaded
# as easily as a source tarball.

# No rules provided inside the 2.6.0.
# This is not good to go following installation.
# Needs some rules and configuration file editing.
# snort has a problem when casting with prelude enabled.
# It prompts for a password.
# This is incredibly bad.
# However, I do not have an immediate fix for it.
# software compilation should be non-interactive

      desc 'lightweight network intrustion detection program
snort is a lightweight network intrusion detection system,
capable of performing real-time traffic analysis and packet
logging on IP networks.
It can perform protocol analysis, content searching/matching
and can be used to detect a variety of attacks and probes,
such as buffer overflows, stealth port scans, CGI attacks,
SMB probes, OS fingerprinting attempts, and much more.
Snort uses a flexible rule based language to describe traffic
that it should collect or pass, and a modular detection engine.
Snort has a real-time alerting capability, with alert mechanisms
for syslog, a user specified file, a UNIX socket, or WinPopup
messages to Windows clients using Samba smbclient.'
