      desc 'python module to find the checksum of files

python-fchksum is a python module to find the checksum of files.
Currently it supports md5, crc32, cksum,
bsd-style sum, and sysv-style sum.
The advantage of using fchksum over the python md5 and
zlib(.crc32) modules is both ease of use and speed.
You only need to tell it the filename
and the actual work is done by C code.
Compared to the implementing a read loop
in python with the standard python modules,
fchksum is up to 2.0x faster in md5 and 1.1x faster in crc32.'
