      desc 'Linux cryptographic filesystem
ecryptfs stacks on existing filesystems.
It provides functionality similar to that of GnuPG,
only the process of encrypting and decrypting the data
is done transparently from the perspective of the application.

Enable support in the linux kernel configuration to use this.'
