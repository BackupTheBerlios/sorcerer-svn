      DESC="dbus is a message bus system,
a simple way for applications to talk to one another.
It supplies both a system daemon (for events such as
\"new hardware device added\" or \"printer queue changed\")
and a per-user-login-session daemon
(for general IPC needs among user applications).
Also, the message bus is built on top of a general one-to-one message
passing framework, which can be used by any two apps to communicate
directly (without going through the message bus daemon)."
