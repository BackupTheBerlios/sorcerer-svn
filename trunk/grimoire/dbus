      desc 'message bus system
a simple way for applications to talk to one another.
It supplies both a system daemon
(for events such as "new hardware device added" or "printer queue changed")
and a per-user-login-session daemon
(for general IPC needs among user applications).
Also, the message bus is built on top of a general one-to-one message
passing framework, which can be used by any two apps to communicate
directly (without going through the message bus daemon).'
