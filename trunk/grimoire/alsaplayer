      DESC="alsaplayer is a PCM player that outputs using ALSA.
It is heavily multi-threaded and tries to
excercise the ALSA library and driver quite a bit.
It has some very interesting features unique to Linux/Unix players.
The goal is to create a fully pluggable framework for playback
of all sorts of media with the focus on PCM audio data.

alsaplayer must be on hold or sold to remain installed
until software authors release a new bug fixed version."
