      DESC="alsaplayer is a PCM player that outputs using ALSA.
It is heavily multi-threaded and tries to
excercise the ALSA library and driver quite a bit.
It has some very interesting features unique to Linux/Unix players.
The goal is to create a fully pluggable framework for playback
of all sorts of media with the focus on PCM audio data."
