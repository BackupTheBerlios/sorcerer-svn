      desc 'immune system

Computer immune systems are similar to human immune systems.
They do not prevent problems from occuring.
But they do detect and correct problems.

sorcery-immune can do 3 checks:

Critical: Detect and fix breaks involving the ELF libraries
          from glibc, ncurses and readline once every 2 minutes.
Neglect:  Boxes not updated for 2 weeks can be updated by immune.
Stall:    Stalled casts can be detected and restarted once per hour.'
