with info    cite 'arbitrary precision numeric processing language
Syntax is similar to C, but differs in many substantial areas.
It supports interactive execution of statements.
Bc is a utility included in the POSIX P1003.2/D11 draft standard.
This version does not use the historical method of
having bc be a calculator for the dc calculator
(the POSIX document does not specify how bc must be implemented).
This version has a single executable that both compiles 
the language and runs the resulting byte code.
The byte code is not the dc language.'
