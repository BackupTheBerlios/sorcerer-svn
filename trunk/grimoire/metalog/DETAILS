Metalog is a modern replacement for syslogd and klogd.
The logged messages can be dispatched according to their facility,
urgency, program name, and/or Perl-compatible regular expressions.
Log files can be automatically rotated when they exceed a certain 
size or age.  External shell scripts (e.g., mail) can be launched 
when specific patterns are found.  Metalog is easier to configure 
than syslogd and syslog-ng, accepts an unlimited number of rules, 
and has (switchable) memory bufferization for maximal performance.
