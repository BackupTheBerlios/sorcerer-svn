The logged messages can be dispatched according
to their facility, urgency, program name,
and/or Perl-compatible regular expressions.
Log files can be automatically rotated
when they exceed a certain size or age.
External shell scripts (e.g., mail)
can be launched when specific patterns are found.
Metalog is easier to configure than syslogd and syslog-ng,
accepts an unlimited number of rules, and has (switchable)
memory bufferization for maximal performance.'
