This directory holds templates for network configurations.

there is 2 kinds of templates :
link templates located in link subdir
network template 

copy a network template to /etc/networks.d/
edit it to have the required links started/stoped according the rule
of the network
for example you can have
/etc/networks.d/home
/etc/networks.d/work

Select the template or templates in link subdir that
best describe the links in the networking connections.
Copy and rename template files to /etc/networks.d/links
Edit the files in      /etc/networks.d/links
Finally, start the network with
# bash /etc/init.d/networks start

A box can be configured for more than one network.
The order in which network connections are attempted during
the execution of /etc/init.d/networks start
is determined by the order of the filenames in /etc/networks.d/
For example if the files are named:

00-work
01-home

Upon bash /etc/init.d/networks start
00-work would be attempted first and if unsuccessful
01-home would be attempted.


	Notes about DNS and resolver configuration files.

Optionally, each network connections can have their own /etc/resolv.conf
The naming of that file follows this pattern.
the /etc/resolv.conf is a link to /var/run/resolv.conf

Network config file	->	resolv.conf name
00-work             ->	/etc/resolv.conf.00-work
01-home             ->	/etc/resolv.conf.01-home

If the /etc/resolv.conf.$network_config exists
then it is copied to /var/run/resolv.conf
when attempting to connect to that network

Rarely, will this be used.
If the same resolver configuration can be used for all networks
then edit /etc/resolv.conf instead.
When a network interface is configured by DHCP
then /etc/resolv.conf is usually automatically modified.
