This directory holds templates for network configurations.
Select the template or templates that
best describe the networking connections.
Copy template files to /etc/networks.d/
Edit the files in      /etc/networks.d/
Finally, start the network with
# bash /etc/init.d/networks start

A box can be configured for more than one network.
The order in which network connections are attempted during
the execution of /etc/init.d/networks start
is determined by the order of the filenames in /etc/networks.d/
For example if the files are named:

00-eth0-dhcp
01-wlan0-dhcp

Upon bash /etc/init.d/networks start
00-eth0-dhcp  would be attempted first and if unsuccessful
01-wlan0-dhcp would be attempted.


	Notes about DNS and resolver configuration files.

Optionally, each network connections can have their own /etc/resolv.conf
The naming of that file follows this pattern.

Network config file	->	resolv.conf name
00-eth0-dhcp		->	/etc/resolv.conf.00-eth0-dhcp
01-wlan-dhcp		->	/etc/resolv.conf.01-wlan-dhcp

If the /etc/resolv.conf.$network_config exists
then it is copied to /etc/resolv.conf
when attempting to connect to that network

Rarely, will this be used.
If the same resolver configuration can be used for all networks
then edit /etc/resolv.conf instead.
When a network interface is configured by DHCP
then /etc/resolv.conf is usually automatically modified.
