This directory holds templates for network configurations.

=======================IMPORTANT==============================
sorcerer network configuration is devided into 2 concepts :
-  the concept of links : a link is a physical link that is part of a 
   network (ethernet, ppp, pppoe, wlan....)
- the concept of network that is an agregation of links ran into proper order

for example a home network might require ethernet then pppoe then ipv6tunnel links
to be started in that order 

for this a network template is provided in /etc/networks.d/templates and links
templates are found in /etc/networks.d/templates/links

======================INSTALLATION=============================
copy a network template to /etc/networks.d/ with a name best describing
the network

copy the associated links to /etc/networks.d/links with appropriate names
you find templates into /etc/networks.d/templates/links

note1 : if your network has only one link you can copy the link directly into
       /etc/networks.d/

note2 : if you have several networks, copy several network templates (note1
        still apply) into /etc/networks.d/, each network will be brougth 
        up in alphabetical order until first success (see section misc info)


=====================configuration============================
take your favorite editor

if you used single link method of note1 then simply edit this files

if you used multilink method :
     -  edit the network template to have it launch the links in the
        order you need (see note3)
     -  edit and configure each link that you copied into /etc/networks.d/links

if you used multiple network of note2 : redo previous step for each networks

note3 : if you look into start function of network template you will see
        commented lines with eth-static and pppoe. Modify thoses lines 
        according to the links you need to bring on for this network. You 
        might also see that pppoe will only be brought up if eth-static 
        has successfully started (the && at end of line means continue on
        success)

======================starting================================
# bash /etc/init.d/networks start


=========================misc info===========================
A box can be configured for more than one network.
The order in which network connections are attempted during
the execution of /etc/init.d/networks start
is determined by the order of the filenames in /etc/networks.d/
For example if the files are named:

00-work
01-home

Upon bash /etc/init.d/networks start
00-work would be attempted first and if unsuccessful
01-home would be attempted.

-----------------------------------------------------------
	Notes about DNS and resolver configuration files.

Optionally, each network connections can have their own /etc/resolv.conf
The naming of that file follows this pattern.
the /etc/resolv.conf is a link to /var/run/resolv.conf

Network config file	->	resolv.conf name
00-work             ->	/etc/resolv.conf.00-work
01-home             ->	/etc/resolv.conf.01-home

If the /etc/resolv.conf.$network_config exists
then it is copied to /var/run/resolv.conf
when attempting to connect to that network

Rarely, will this be used.
If the same resolver configuration can be used for all networks
then edit /etc/resolv.conf instead.
When a network interface is configured by DHCP
then /etc/resolv.conf is usually automatically modified.
