1. Concept

Sorcerer network configuration is devided into 2 concepts:
A. Links:
    a link may be an interface or physical link
    that is part of a network: ethernet, ppp, pppoe, wlan, ....
B. Networks:
    a network is an agregation of links

For example, a home network could require ethernet 
then PPPOE then ipv6tunnel links to be started in that order 

Network templates are provided in /etc/networks.d/templates/
Link    templates are provided in /etc/networks.d/templates/links/


2. Installation

Copy the network template file
/etc/networks.d/templates/neworks to /etc/networks.d/
Rename it to describe the network.
Then, edit it to properly start and stop the network.

Copy the associated links template to /etc/networks.d/links/
Rename it to describe the interface and configuration.
Edit it to properly define required variables while
commenting out unused variables.

When the only network has only one link
then the link template can be copied directly into: /etc/networks.d/
instead of the network template.

When there are several networks
each network template in /etc/networks.d/
will be started in alphabetical order until the first success.


3. Starting and Stopping

# bash /etc/init.d/networks start
# bash /etc/init.d/networks stop


4. Additional Information

By using more than one network templates
a box can be configured to connect to more than one network.

The order in which network connections are attempted
during the execution of /etc/init.d/networks start
is determined by the order of the filenames in /etc/networks.d/
For example if the files are named:

00-work
01-home

Upon bash /etc/init.d/networks start
00-work would be attempted first and if unsuccessful
01-home would be attempted.
