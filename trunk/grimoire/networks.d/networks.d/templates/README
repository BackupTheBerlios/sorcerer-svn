This directory holds templates for network configurations.
Select the template or templates that
best describe the networking connections.
Copy template files to /etc/networks.d/
Edit the files in      /etc/networks.d/
Finally, start the network by
bash /etc/init.d/networks start

A box can be configured for more than one network.
The order in which network connections are attempted during
the execution of bash /etc/init.d/networks start
is determined by the order of the filenames in /etc/networks.d/
For example if the files are named:

00eth0-dhcp
01wlan0-dhcp

Upon bash /etc/init.d/networks start
00eth0-dhcp  would be attempted first and if unsuccessful
01wlan0-dhcp would be attempted.
