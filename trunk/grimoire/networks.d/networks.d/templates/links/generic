# Comment unused variables for proper execution.


# For Dial up and PPP configured network connection
# no variables or telephone numbers are stored here.
# Please configure either rp-pppoe, wvdial or dial2net.
# To configure pppoe     execute: pppoe-setup
# To configure wvdial    execute: wvdialconf then edit /etc/wvdial.conf
# To configure dial2net  execute: dial2net -s
# Please dispel rp-pppoe wvdial dial2net when not using them.


# MODULE=				# Optional

# The IF variable is required except for PPP connections
# Some potential values are: eth0 wlan0 wifi0 eth1 ra0 ...
# Please assign the correct network interface for IF

# IF=eth0


# Wireless Variables useful for WEP if using WPA then see further below

# KEY=					# Optional
# MODE=Managed				# Required
# ESSID=any				# Required
# AP=					# Optional access point address
# RETRY=512				# Optional wireless packet retry count


# If setting the MAC address
# MAC=


# IP Variables

# If using DHCP then IP addresses with are not required
# One or more IPv4 and/or IPv6 addresses are fine

# IPA=( 192.168.1.32/24
#       192.168.1.33/24
#       2002:c0a8:0120::1/16 
#       2002:c0a8:0121::1/16 )

# When IP addresses are required
# then gateway addresses are recommended.

# GATEWAY=( 192.168.1.1
#           2002:c058:6301::1 )


# BROADCAST=( 192.168.1.255 )		# Optional
# DHCP_OPTS=""				# Optional


# Define WPA_CONF and WPA_ACTION to use wpa_supplicant
# Also edit the files specified by $WPA_CONF and $WPA_ACTION
# Both $WPA_CONF and $WPA_ACTION are optional since an init-script
# /etc/init.d/wpa_supplicant now starts wpa_supplicant daemon during boot.
# A properly set /etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf
# is strongly recommended.
# IPv4 and IPv6 network configuration can be accomplished automatically
# through dhcpcd or set statically using above variables.

# WPA_CONF=/etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_wifi.conf
# WPA_ACTION=/etc/wpa_supplicant/action

# Functions to interpret variables are sourced in from:

# When sourced in start and stop functions are insufficient
# Please write custom start and stop functions here.
