     SHORT="xdialog is a dialog replacement that outputs to X instead of console."
      LONG="
Xdialog is designed to be a drop-in replacement 
for the dialog and cdialog programs.
It converts any terminal-based program 
into a program with an X interface.
The dialogs are easier to see and use, and Xdialog 
adds more functionality such as a help button and box, 
a treeview, an editbox, file and directory selectors, 
a range box, and a calendar.
It uses GTK+, and will match your desktop theme.
