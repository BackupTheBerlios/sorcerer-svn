      desc 'Xdialog is a dialog replacement that outputs to X instead of console.
Xdialog is designed to be a drop-in replacement
for the dialog and cdialog programs.
It converts any terminal-based program
into a program with an X interface.
The dialogs are easier to see and use, and Xdialog
adds more functionality such as a help button and box,
a treeview, an editbox, file and directory selectors,
a range box, and a calendar.
It uses GTK+, and will match your desktop theme.'
