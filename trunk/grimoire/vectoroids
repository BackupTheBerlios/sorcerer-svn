      DESC="vectoroids is based on the X-Window PDA game Agendaroids
vectoroids is based on the X-Window PDA game 'Agendaroids,'
but uses libSDL for graphics, sound, and input, and includes
nicer graphics, sound effects, and music.
The objective is to survive wave after wave of giant rocks,
which you must shoot to break into smaller pieces,
until they are completely destroyed."
