It sends Router Advertisement messages,
specified by RFC 2461,
to a local Ethernet LAN periodically
and when requested by a node sending a Router Solicitation message.
These messages are required for IPv6 stateless autoconfiguration.

This release includes support for Mobile IPv6,
6to4 addressing, router preferences and more
specific routes, and non-broadcast multiple-access links such as ISATAP.
Both Linux and BSD are supported.
