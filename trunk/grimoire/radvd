      DESC="The router advertisement daemon (radvd) is run by Linux or BSD systems acting as IPv6 routers.
 It sends Router Advertisement messages, specified by RFC 2461, to a local Ethernet LAN 
periodically and when requested by a node sending a Router Solicitation message. These
messages are required for IPv6 stateless autoconfiguration.

This release includes support for Mobile IPv6, 6to4 addressing, router preferences and more
specific routes, and non-broadcast multiple-access links such as ISATAP. Both Linux and BSD
are supported. For more information about recent modifications, please see the CHANGES file
included with the latest release of radvd."
