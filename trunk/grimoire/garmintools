      DESC="garmintools communicates with Garmin Forerunner 305
via the USB interface. It implements all of the documented Garmin
protocols as of Rev C (May 19, 2006) over the USB physical link.
This means that if you have a Garmin with a USB connection to a PC, 
you ought to be able to use this software to communicate with it.
If you're looking for a complete solution to all of your Linux Garmin 
GPS needs, this is not it. I own a Garmin Forerunner 305 and wrote 
this code specifically so I could download and save data from that 
particular GPS unit to my Linux machine. I tried gpsbabel, but found 
that it did not have command line options specific to the Forerunner 
run and lap data - all I could do was get the tracklog. That's how 
all of this got started. I also wanted a few other things, like the 
ability to convert a track log into a Google maps encoded polyline, 
and (eventually) the ability to generate PNG images of heart rate 
and elevation data.
