rp-pppoe, Roaring Penguin, is a PPPoE client and server suite for Linux,
NetBSD, Solaris, and Mac OS X Beta. It is fully RFC-compliant and
supports cookies, relay-IDs, and multiple simultaneous PPPoE discovery
phases.  It is cleanly coded and fairly efficient, and supports
kernel-mode PPPoE on Linux 2.4.x.
