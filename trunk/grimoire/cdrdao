with info    cite 'program to write DAO audio or data cdrs
cdrdao records audio/data CD-Rs in disk-at-once (DAO) mode 
based on a textual description of the CD contents (toc-file).
Features include full control over length and 
contents of pre-gaps (pause areas between tracks).
Pre-gaps may be completely omitted, e.g. 
for dividing live recordings into tracks.
Control over sub-channel data like catalog numbers, 
copy, pre-emphasis, 2-/4-channel flags, ISRC
code, and index marks are provided as well.
Cdrdao also has support for exact audio CD copying.
Tracks may be composed of different audio 
files supporting non-destructive cuts.'
