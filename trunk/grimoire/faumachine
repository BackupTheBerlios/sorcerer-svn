      DESC="faumachine is a virtual machine that emulates a PC.
It runs as a normal user process (no root privileges or
kernel modules needed) on top of Linux on i386 hardware.
FAUmachine supports networking and FAUmachines can be
connected transparently to the local network to which
their host machine is attached.
If the appropriate servers are running on the FAUmachine,
login from any real machine is possible, once the network is set up.
faumachine used to be known as user mode linux."
