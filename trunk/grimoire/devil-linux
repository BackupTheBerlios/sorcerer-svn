      desc 'dedicated firewall/router niche distribution of free software
Devil Linux was originally intended
to be a dedicated firewall/router distribution
but now Devil-Linux can also be used
as a dedicated server for many applications.
Optional mass storage devices can be easily attached.
Many network services are included in the distribution.

No single tool is best for every task.
Tools such as a screw driver,
which are specialized for driving screws,
tend to produce a more favorable result
as compared to driving a screw with a hammer.
Therefore, Sorcerer,
which does not aspire to fulfill a specific niche,
may be less suited for the task of a dedicated firewall
as compared to a distribution that aspires to fulfill that niche.
devil-linux may appeal to Sorcerer SAs that
prefer trying a pre-compiled software solution.'
