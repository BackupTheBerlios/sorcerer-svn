      DESC="ifplugd is a daemon for automatically configuring one's ethernet connection.

ifplugd is a Linux daemon which will automatically configure 
your ethernet device when a cable is plugged in and 
automatically unconfigure it if the cable is pulled.
This is useful on laptops with onboard network adapters, 
since it will only configure the interface 
when a cable is really connected.
