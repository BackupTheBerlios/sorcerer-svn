      DESC="ifplugd is a daemon for automatically configuring one's ethernet connection.
ifplugd is a Linux daemon which will automatically configure
your ethernet device when a cable is plugged in and
automatically unconfigure it if the cable is pulled.
This is useful on laptops with onboard network adapters,
since it will only configure the interface
when a cable is really connected."
