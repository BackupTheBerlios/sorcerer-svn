with info    cite 'transparent FTP proxy which requires ipfilter
It requires ipfilter on a box acting as a firewall/nat.
It supports caching of FTP downloads,
either by redirecting through a Squid proxy,
or through its own local cache.
Downloads may also be transparently scanned
for viruses (through an external scanner).
Additionally there is an interface for writing
scripts to add features or modify frox
behavior, and examples are included to limit
download file size and to transparently direct
connections to specific hosts to mirror servers.
The proxy is written with security in mind,
and in the default setup runs as a non-root
user in a chroot jail.'
