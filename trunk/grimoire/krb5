# as of 20130413 krb5 is newer,
# but installs ELFs with the same soname
# but with a lesser value.
# Therefore, kerberos 5 headers might be used for compilation
# while heimdal's libraries are used for linking
# and that could cause link failures.
# hmm, what to do about multiple installed kerberos?
