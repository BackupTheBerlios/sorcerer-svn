cat << EOF
Kerberos was created by MIT as a 
solution to network security problems.
The Kerberos protocol uses strong 
cryptography so that a client can
prove its identity to a server 
(and vice versa) across an insecure
network connection.
After a client and server has used 
Kerberos to prove their identity, 
they can also encrypt all of their 
communications to assure privacy 
and data integrity as they go about
their business.
