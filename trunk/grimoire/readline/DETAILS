readline - Lets users edit command lines as they are typed in.
The readline library provides a set of functions for use by 
applications that allow users to edit command lines as they are typed.
Both Emacs and vi editing modes are available.
The Readline library includes additional functions to 
maintain a list of previously-entered command lines, 
to recall and perhaps reedit those lines, and perform
csh-like history expansion on previous commands.
