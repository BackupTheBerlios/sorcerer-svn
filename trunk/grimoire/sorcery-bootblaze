      DESC='sorcery-bootblaze maximizes boot speed.

Most of the programs that a computer uses
are started during boot
and within the first 5 minutes after booting begins.
However, files are not usually opened and read
until the moment that a program requires them.
This creates a delay while the file is read from disk.

bootblaze learns what files are opened in /usr
during the first 5 minutes.
On subsequent boots it loads files into the kernel cache.
Then when a program requires file content the content
is quickly retrieved from the kernel cache instead of
waiting for the file to be read from disk.'
