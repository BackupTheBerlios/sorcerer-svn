      DESC="kbackup is a program for backing up directories or files.
It uses an easy-to-use directory tree to select the things to back up.
The program was designed to be very simple to use so that it can be
used by those who are not computer experts.
The storage format is tar compressed with bzip2 or gzip.
It also includes German, French, Italian, and Russian translations
for the user interface and English and German translations of the handbook."
