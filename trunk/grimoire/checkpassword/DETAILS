checkpassword provides a simple, uniform password 
checking interface to all root applications.
It is suitable for use by applications 
such as login, ftpd, and pop3d.
There are checkpassword compatible tools that 
support alternate password databases, secret login names, 
long  passwords, subaccounts, one-time passwords, 
detailed accounting, and many other features. 
Applications that use the checkpassword 
interface will work with all of these tools. 
Several tools have been specifically 
designed to support POP toasters.
