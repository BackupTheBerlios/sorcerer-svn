UnixCW is a package of UNIX-based programs that fit together to form a
CW tutor program similar to CP222 by VU2ZAP.  The core of the package
is cwlib, a general-purpose CW functions library.  There are four
programs in the package built around this library: a simple Morse code
sounding program; a small random character generator; a curses-based
Morse code tutor; and a Qt-based (X windows) Morse code tutor.
The Qt-based tutor program offers send practice as well as receive.
The package includes complete man pages.
