      DESC="Complete suite of morse code programs.
UnixCW is a package of UNIX-based programs that fit together
to form a CW tutor program similar to CP222 by VU2ZAP.
The core of the package is cwlib, a general-purpose CW functions library.
There are four programs in the package built around this library:
a simple Morse code sounding program;
a small random character generator;
a curses-based Morse code tutor;
and a Qt-based (X windows) Morse code tutor.
The Qt-based tutor program offers send practice as well as receive.
The package includes complete man pages."
