      desc 'jargonates text through a pipe or as a library
talkfilters are filter/pipe programs that convert ordinary English
text into text that mimics a stereotyped or otherwise humorous dialect.
These filters have been in the public domain for many years,
but now are provided as a single integrated source tarball.
This version of the package also provides the filters as
a C library, so they can be easily embedded in other programs.
A patch is also included to integrate the talk
filters with the GAIM instant messenger program.'
