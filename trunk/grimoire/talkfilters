talkfilters are filter/pipe programs that convert ordinary English 
text into text that mimics a stereotyped or otherwise humorous dialect.
These filters have been in the public domain for many years, but now 
for the first time they are provided as a single integrated package.
This version of the package also provides the filters as 
a C library, so they can be easily embedded in other programs.
A patch is also included to integrate the talk 
filters with the GAIM instant messenger program.
