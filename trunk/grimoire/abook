      desc "address book program with mutt mail client support
abook is a text-based addressbook program
designed to use with mutt mail client.

If you want to use abook with mutt you should add following lines
to your  ~/.muttrc or to the system wide /etc/Muttrc file.

set query_command=\"abook --mutt-query '%s'\"
macro pager A |'abook --add-email'\n

After this you can make queries from
mutt using the query command ('Q')
and add sender e-mail addresses to the
addressbook from pager using 'A' command."
