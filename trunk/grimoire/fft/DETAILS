FFT is an alternative traceroute program for displaying 
the route packets take to an IP network host.
Unlike Van Jacobson's traceroute, which is available 
on almost every platform today,  FFT uses TCP in order 
to elicit ICMP TIME_EXCEEDEDs or other IP route data.
As a result, FFT often executes much faster and 
sees behind some configurations of firewalls.
It also does AS number and netblock name lookups en route.
Most importantly, FFT can trace specific TCP-based protocol 
routes (not just IP) to assist network engineers in isolating 
network and application problems.
