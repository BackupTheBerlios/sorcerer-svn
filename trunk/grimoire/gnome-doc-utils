      desc 'gnome-doc-utils is a collection of documentation utilities.
Notably, it contains utilities for building documentation and
all auxiliary files in your source tree, and it contains the
DocBook XSLT stylesheets that were once distributed with Yelp.
Starting with Gnome 2.8, Yelp will require gnome-doc-utils for the XSLT.'
