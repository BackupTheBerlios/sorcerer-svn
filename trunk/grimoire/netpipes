      desc 'netpipes is a package to manipulate BSD TCP/IP stream sockets

netpipes makes TCP/IP streams usable in shell scripts.
It can also simplify client/server code by allowing the 
programmer to skip all the tedious programming bits 
related to sockets and concentrate on writing a filter/service.'
