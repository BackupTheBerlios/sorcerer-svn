      DESC="sphinx-command executs programmable commands by voice activation.

sphinx-command is an incredibly simple easy to modify
integrated collection of BASH script to execute commands
by voice.

For example I say: GNOME TERMINAL,   and a gnome-terminal pops open
         or I say: GNOME DICTIONARY, and gnome-dictionary pops open.
         or I say: LOCK,             and xlock locks and blanks my screen.

spinx-commands has programed over 30 commands already,
and has a language model ccorpus of over 120 words that
it can recognize alone or in sequences/sentences.
If the concept of voice activated hot-keys amuses you,
then you will enjoy customizing this toy."
