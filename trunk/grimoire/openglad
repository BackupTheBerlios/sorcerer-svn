openglad is an SDL port of an old DOS game called Gladiator,
which was developed by FSGames in the mid 1990.
It is a top-down gauntlet-style RPG in which you hire team mates,
go on missions, and improve your team with the spoils you reap.
It can be played by up to 4 players (using split-screen),
and features many classes, special abilities, and a scenario editor.'
