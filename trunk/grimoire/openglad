Openglad is an SDL port of an old DOS game called 
Gladiator, which was developed by FSGames in the mid 90's.
It is a top-down gauntlet-style RPG in which you hire team mates, 
go on missions, and improve your team with the spoils you reap.
It can be played by up to 4 players (using split-screen), 
and features many classes, special abilities, and a scenario editor.
