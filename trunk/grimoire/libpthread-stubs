      DESC="libpthread-stubs provides library for...
weak aliases for pthread functions not provided in libc
or otherwise available by default.
Libraries like libxcb rely on pthread
stubs to use pthreads optionally,
becoming thread-safe when linked to libpthread,
while avoiding any performance hit when running single-threaded.
libpthread-stubs supports this behavior even on platforms
which do not supply all the necessary pthread stubs.
On platforms which already supply all the necessary pthread stubs,
this package ships only the pkg-config file pthread-stubs.pc,
to allow libraries to unconditionally express a dependency
on pthread-stubs and still obtain correct behavior."
