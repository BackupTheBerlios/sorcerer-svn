      LONG="
Pavuk is a Web grabber with an optional GTK GUI, 
and optional support for downloading with multiple threads.
It supports the HTTP, HTTPS, FTP, FTP via SSL, and Gopher 
protocols, as well as HTTP GET, and POST requests.
It is capable of filling HTML forms while downloading HTML 
trees, and lets you mirror Web documents for local browsing.
You can even synchronize changes to these documents.
Recent versions also support processing of Javascript 
patterns in HTML pages.
Pavuk has JavaScript bindings that allow writing 
of own scripts to perform special tasks.
