      desc 'gizmod controls computer based on events from input devices.
It has built-in support for all Linux input devices, including
keyboards with special keys, joysticks, remotes, dials, and more.
It lets you control applications, launch programs, change the
system volume, switch desktops, and directly control XMMS/BMP.
It has special support for the Griffin PowerMate USB Dial,
allowing certain events to be visualized on the PowerMate LED
(such as XMMS/BMP sound output, CPU usage, etc.).
It features support for RF Remotes such as the ATI X10 Remote,
allowing it to have per-application key mappings and
configurable sensitivity settings (handy for MythTV users).
It also has XOSD support for nifty (TV-friendly) on-screen displays.'
