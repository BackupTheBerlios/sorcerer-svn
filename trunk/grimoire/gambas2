# gambas2 requires some header files from poppler
# that poppler does not normally install.
# Rather than fix this we shall wait until further releases
# of gambas2 to see if the software authors fix their oversight.
# 2.23.1 was missing a configure script.
# did the software author properly prepare the source tree?

# why does it use gnome version scheme when not provided on gnome's ftp server?

# Version 2.24.0 was missing typical preparation such as
# running aclocal, libtoolize, automake, etc...
