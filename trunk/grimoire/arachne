      desc 'seam carving program
written to demonstrate Seamstress seam carving library.
They were both written by Hayden Walles.
Seam carving is a technique developed by Shai Avidan and
Ariel Shamir for resizing images by removing the boring
bits (content-aware image resizing as they call it).
Seamstress is an independent implementation of seam carving.
The Seamstress library is a portable and takes care of the
details of doing many of the things described by Avidan and Shamir.
Others (like image expansion) are
easy to implement yourself using the library.
Arachne is a GTK+ program designed
to show off Seamstress at its best.
It allows you to do the realtime fluid resizing with any image.'
