      DESC="arachne is a seam carving program 
written to demonstrate Seamstress seam carving library.
They were both written by Hayden Walles.
Seam carving is a technique developed by Shai Avidan and 
Ariel Shamir for resizing images by removing the boring 
bits (content-aware image resizing as they call it).
Seamstress is an independent implementation of seam carving. 
The Seamstress library is a portable and takes care of the 
details of doing many of the things described by Avidan and 
Shamir. Others (like image expansion) are easy to implement 
yourself using the library.
Arachne is a GTK+ program designed to show off Seamstress at 
its best. It allows you to do the realtime fluid resizing with 
any image."
