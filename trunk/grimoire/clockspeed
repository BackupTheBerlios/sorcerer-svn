      DESC="clockspeed uses a hardware tick counter to compensate for a persistently fast or slow system clock.
clockspeed uses a hardware tick counter to compensate for a persistently
fast or slow system clock. Given a few time measurements from a reliable
source, it computes and then eliminates the clock skew.sntpclock checks
another system's NTP clock, and prints the results in a format suitable
for input to clockspeed.
sntpclock is the simplest available NTP/SNTP client.taiclock 
and taiclockdform an even simpler alternative to SNTP.
They are suitable for precise time synchronization over a local area network,
without the hassles and potential security problems of an NTP server."
