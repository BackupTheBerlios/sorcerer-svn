clockspeed uses a hardware tick counter to compensate for a persistently
fast or slow system clock.
Given a few time measurements from a reliable source,
clockspeed computes and then eliminates the clock skew.
sntpclock checks another system NTP clock,
and prints the results in a format suitable for input to clockspeed.
sntpclock is the simplest available NTP/SNTP client.
taiclock and taiclockdform an even simpler alternative to SNTP.
They are suitable for precise time synchronization over a local area network,
without the hassles and potential security problems of an NTP server.'
