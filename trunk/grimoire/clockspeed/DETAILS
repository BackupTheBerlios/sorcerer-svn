      DESC="clockspeed uses a hardware tick counter to compensate for a persistently fast or slow system clock.

clockspeed uses a hardware tick counter to compensate for a persistently
fast or slow system clock. Given a few time measurements from a reliable 
source, it computes and then eliminates the clock skew.sntpclock checks 
another system's NTP clock, and prints the results in a format suitable 
for input to clockspeed. 
sntpclock is the simplest available NTP/SNTP client.taiclock and taiclockd 
form an even simpler alternative to SNTP. T
hey are suitable for precise time synchronization over a local area network, 
without the hassles and potential security problems of an NTP server.
