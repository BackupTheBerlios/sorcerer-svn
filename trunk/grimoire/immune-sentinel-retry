      desc "random compile failure protection

Some sources may fail to compile on first attempt
due to a random and non repeatable failure.
This sentinel will retry compilation
after a period of time elapsed.
Both the delay and amount of retires are configurable.
The default is a 30 minute delay with 1 retry."
