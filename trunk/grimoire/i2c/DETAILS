i2c contains all the basic i2c code, as well as a few 
bus drivers (both the algorithm and the adapter drivers). 
There are no real chip drivers, so on its own it is not very 
useful. Lots of chip drivers, as well as more bus drivers and 
some additional basic code (for SMBus emulation over i2c) and 
some i2c debugging tools are found in the lm_sensors package.
Another place at which I2C is used is the video4linux project.
