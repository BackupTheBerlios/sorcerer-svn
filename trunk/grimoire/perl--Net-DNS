      desc 'perl--Net provides an interface to the DNS resolver
Net::DNS is a collection of Perl modules
that act as a Domain Name System (DNS) resolver.
It allows the programmer to perform DNS queries
that are beyond the capabilities of gethostbyname and gethostbyaddr.
The programmer should be somewhat familiar with the format of a DNS 
packet and its various sections'
