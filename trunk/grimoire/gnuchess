      DESC="gnuchess is a chess game.
gnuchess lets most modern computers play a full game of chess.
It has a plain terminal interface but supports visual interfaces
such as X-Windows xboard and Windows-for-PC winboard as well
as a full 3-dimensional wooden chess-board protocol for the
Novag Chess board enabling one to be relatively free of the
computer itself."
