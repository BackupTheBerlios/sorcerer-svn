      desc 'openexr_ctl provides a simplified OpenEXR interface to CTL

exrdpx is an initial version of a CTL-driven file converter
that translates DPX files into OpenEXR files and vice versa.
The conversion between the DPX and OpenEXR color spaces is
handled by CTL transforms.

exr_ctl_exr is an initial version of a program that can bake
the effect of a series of CTL transforms into the pixels of
an OpenEXR file.'
