# I created this alternate build on 20090831 because the update
# involving libxcb which removed libxcb-xlib.so.0 became a problem
# since running gtk-query-immodules-2.0 as part of the default install
# of gtk+ can fail due to input modules provided by uim and scim
# having not yet been recompiled since they require gtk+
# and yet having references to now undefined symbols.
# Using DESTDIR to compile gtk+ omits the execution of
# gtk-query-immodules-2.0 and gdk-pixbuf-query-loaders which are used to create files
# /etc/gtk-2.0/gtk.immodules and /etc/gtk-2.0/gdk-pixbuf.loaders, respectively.
# Separate spells with the same names as the programs
# now exist in order to create those files.
