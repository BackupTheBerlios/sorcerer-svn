      desc 'gmerlin provides libraries for multimedia applications
It also includes a full featured media player with gtk+ GUI,
an audio/video transcoder, a webcam application, and an ALSA mixer.
The libraries provide many low-level functions
like handling of uncompressed A/V streams or
decoding a wide range of multimedia formats.
All libraries were written with good reusability in mind,
so you can easily write your own applications based on gmerlin libraries.'
