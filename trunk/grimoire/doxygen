doxygen is a cross-platform, JavaDoc-like
documentation system for C++, Java, C, and IDL.
Doxygen can be used to generate an on-line class
browser (in HTML) and/or an off-line reference
manual (in LaTeX or RTF) from a set of source files.
Doxygen can also be configured to extract the
code-structure from undocumented source files.
This includes dependency graphs, class diagrams
and hyperlinked source code.
This type of information can be very useful to
quickly find your way in large source distributions.'
