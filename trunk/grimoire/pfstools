      DESC="pfstools manipulate HDR images and video frames
pfstools package is a set of command line programs for reading, 
writing and manipulating high-dynamic range (HDR) images and 
video frames. It includes also Qt and OpenGL HDR image viewers. 
pfstools can be integrated with GNU Octave or matlab, so that 
it can serve as a toolbox for reading and writing HDR images.

All programs in the package exchange image data using unix pipes 
and a simple generic HDR image format - pfs. pfs in not just 
another format for storing HDR images (and there are already 
quite a few of them), but is rather an attempt to integrate 
the existing HDR image formats by providing a simple interface 
for exchanging data between applications.

pfstools is a base set of tools and more advanced functionality 
can be found in related packages, such as PFStmo (tone-mapping) 
or PFScalibration (recovery of camera response curve and merging 
multi-exposure LDR image). If you are not comfortable with a 
command line interface or you want to save yourself compilation 
problems, you may want to check Qtpfsgui, which packages some 
functionality of PFStmo and PFScalibration in a nice GUI interface.
