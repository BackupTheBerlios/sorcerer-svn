      desc 'fast Bayesian spam filtering
bogofilter is a Bayesian spam filter.
In its normal mode of operation it takes an email message
or other text on standard input, does a statistical check
against lists of good and bad words, and returns a
status code indicating whether or not the message is spam.
Bogofilter is designed with fast algorithms, uses the
Berkeley DB for fast startup and lookups, coded directly
in C, and tuned for speed, so it can be used for
production by sites that process a lot of mail.'
