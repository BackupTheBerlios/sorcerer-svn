      desc 'gentoo is a gtk+-v1.2 based file manager.
gentoo is a modern, powerful, flexible, and
utterly configurable file manager for UNIX
systems, written using the gtk+-v1.2 toolkit.
It aims to be 100% graphically configurable;
there is no need to edit config files by hand
and then restart the application.
Gentoo is somewhat inspired in its
look & feel by the classic Amiga program
DirectoryOpus 4, but is not a clone.'
