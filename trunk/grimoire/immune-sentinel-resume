If cast or leech stall
sentinel resume will restart them.
If the SA freezes a moiling technic
and then forgets about the technic
then sentinel resume will thaw the technic after 8 hours.

Technics intentionally queued with future time stamps
will eventually become a stalled technic when
their time stamp is no longer in the future.
When that happens immune-sentinel-resume
will resume the stalled technics.
Therefore, immune-sentinel-resume provides a cron like ability."
