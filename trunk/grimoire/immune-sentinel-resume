      desc "stall and freeze protection
If cast or leech stall
sentinel resume will restart them.
If the SA freezes a casting spell
and then forgets about the spell
then sentinel resume will thaw the spell after 8 hours.

Spells intentionally queued with future time stamps
will eventually become a stalled spell when
their time stamp is no longer in the future.
When that happens immune-sentinel-resume
will resume the stalled spells.
Therefore, immune-sentinel-resume enhances
sorcery with a cron like ability."
