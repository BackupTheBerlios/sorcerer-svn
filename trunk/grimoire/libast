It contains many spiffy things, and it is a library.
Thus, the ever-so-creative name.
My current plan is to gradually remove some of the neat 
stuff from Eterm that could be made generic (things like 
the theme parsing engine, the command-line options parser, 
perhaps the event engine, ...) and place it here in the 
hopes that others will find them useful.
