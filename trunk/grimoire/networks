      DESC="networks provides scripts and templates to aid network configuration.

networks is an approach to network configuration
that embraces both simplicity and flexibility.
To configure a network connection copy only
the most appropriate template files from
/etc/networks.d/templates/ to /etc/networks.d/
Then, modify the files in /etc/networks.d/
Finally, start the network connection by executing:
# bash /etc/init.d/networks start


Rationale for Change

An ancient fact that shapes Sorcerer development
differently than the majority of distros is that
Sorcerer SAs prefer having both variables and instructions
involving a service start and stop to be in the same file.
This way SAs can quickly and completely customize
exactly what is done when a service starts and stops.
However, to grant better support for common
network configurations the old /etc/init.d/network
script would eventually become both large and complicated.
Therefore, this compromise was established that
maintains simplicity while allowing for a box
to be simultaneously configured for multiple networks.
This change does not depart from the tradition.
Files in /etc/networks.d/ must contain both the variables and 
the instructions required for each type of network configuration.
Having each template contains only and exactly what is
required for that type of network configuration avoids
SAs becomming bewildered and fatigued by reading and modifying
a long and complex single /etc/init.d/network script."
