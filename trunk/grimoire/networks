networks is an approach to network configuration
that embraces both simplicity and flexibility.
To configure a network connection copy only
the most appropriate template files from
/etc/networks.d/templates/ to /etc/networks.d/
Then, modify the files in /etc/networks.d/
Finally, start the network connection by executing:
# bash /etc/init.d/networks start'

build(){
mkdir -p $DESTDIR/etc
find   $SCRIPT_DIR/networks.d -type f | xargs --max-lines=256 chmod 600
cp -av $SCRIPT_DIR/networks.d $DESTDIR/etc/
echo "networks $VERSION installed"
}
