      DESC="powertweak is a tool to tune your system to its optimal performance settings.

powertweak is a tool to tune your system to its optimal performance settings.
It started life as the replacement for the now obsolete kernel option 
'tune PCI bridges', and has been extended to provide more features and 
support more chipsets.
It can also tune network/filesystem performance using /proc/sys 
entries, disk elevator settings, and x86 CPU registers, 
CDROM speeds, hdparm type features, and Sony VAIO backlight.
It has both a GTK GUI and a text-based lister.
