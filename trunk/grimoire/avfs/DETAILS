avfs is A Virtual File System is an easy-to-install system 
that enables all programs to access archived, compressed, 
remote, or other kind of virtual files without the need to 
recompile programs or the kernel.
The following modules are currently implemented: 
tar, zip, rar, gzip, bzip2, ftp, http, dav, 
rsh/ssh, floppy, and many more.

In order to use avfs the linux kernel must be compiled with 
support for the network file system CODA directly or as a module.

As of version 0.9.3 virtual file writing does not work.
