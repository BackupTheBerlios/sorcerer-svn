with info    cite 'library for reporting system information
libgtop is a library that fetches information about the running
system such as cpu and memory usage, active processes etc.
On Linux systems, these information are taken directly from the
/proc filesystem while on other systems a server is used to read
those information from /dev/kmem or similar.'
