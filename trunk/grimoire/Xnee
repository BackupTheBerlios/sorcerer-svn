      desc 'xnee can record, distribute and replay X protocol data
This is useful for automated tests of applications or benchmarking
of applications, think of it as a robot.
This software can then help you control several X11

You must activate record extensions of X11 to have it work
(modify section modules of your X configuration file)'
