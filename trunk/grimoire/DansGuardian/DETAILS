     SHORT="A Web filter with multiple page content analysis mechanisms."
      LONG="
DansGuardian is a web content filter.
It filters the actual content of pages 
based on many methods including phrase matching, 
PICS filtering and URL filtering.
It does not purely filter based on a banned list 
of sites like lesser totally commercial filters.
DansGuardian is designed to be completely flexible 
and allows you to tailor the filtering to your exact needs.
It can be as draconian or as unobstructive as you want.
The default settings are geared towards what a primay 
school might want but DansGuardian puts you in control
of what you want to block.
DansGuardian is a true web content filter. 
---
It needs running web (eg. httpd) & proxy (eg. squid) 
servers in order to function.
Also consider putting a line like :
0 3 * * sun /etc/dansguardian/logrotation
in root's crontab to rotate the logs once a week.
