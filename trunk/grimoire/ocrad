It is mplemented as a filter and based on a feature extraction method.
It reads a bitmap image in PBM format and
produces text in byte (8-bit) or UTF-8 formats.
It also includes a layout analyzer that is able to separate the
columns or blocks of text normally found on printed pages.
Ocrad can be used as a stand-alone console application,
or as a backend to other programs."
