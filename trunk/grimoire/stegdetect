Stegdetect is an automated tool for detecting steganographic content in
images.  It is capable of detecting several different steganographic
methods to embed hidden information in JPEG images.  Currently, the
detectable schemes are

- jsteg,
- jphide (unix and windows),
- invisible secrets,
- and outguess 0.13b.

OutGuess 0.2 can not be detected using these techniques.
Stegbreak is used to launch dictionary attacks against JSteg-Shell,
JPHide and OutGuess 0.13b.
