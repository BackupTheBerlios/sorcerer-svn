      LONG="
bfr maintains a buffer of data collected from stdin, 
emitting the data to stdout.
It will both read and write at the speed each stream can 
handle, and allows you to set thresholds of when to start 
outputting and inputting again (after reaching a full buffer), 
the size of the buffer, as well as monitor content/throughput 
with an optional progress-bar.
It also includes bfp, a variant especially 
written to play audio data using /dev/dsp.
