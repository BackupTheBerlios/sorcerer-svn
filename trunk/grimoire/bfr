 freshmeat buffer
      desc 'reads from stdin writes to stdout at rates each can handle

Please note that bfr was tried with a Sorcerer I/R and caused problems.
bfr 1.6 was released on 20040303 and might have bugs.

bfr maintains a buffer of data collected from stdin,
emitting the data to stdout.
It will both read and write at the speed each stream can
handle, and allows you to set thresholds of when to start
outputting and inputting again (after reaching a full buffer),
the size of the buffer, as well as monitor content/throughput
with an optional progress-bar.
It also includes bfp, a variant especially
written to play audio data using /dev/dsp.'
