with info    cite 'file manager
emelfm2 is a file manager that
implements the popular two-pane design.
It features a simple gtk interface,
a flexible filetyping scheme,
and a built-in command line for executing
commands without opening an xterm.'

# add WITH_GTK3=1 to make's command line
# and emelfm2 will compile and link with gtk+-3.0 instead of gtk+

build(){
 make         PREFIX=/usr &&
 make install PREFIX="$DESTDIR"/usr
# I wish the line below worked
#make install PREFIX=/usr "DESTDIR=$DESTDIR"
}
