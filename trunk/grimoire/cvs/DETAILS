cvs is a version control system, which keeps old versions
of files (usually source code), keep a log of who, when, 
and why changes occurred, etc., like RCS or SCCS.
Unlike the simpler systems, CVS does not just operate 
on one file at a time or one directory at a time,
but operates on hierarchical collections of 
directories consisting of version controlled files.
CVS helps to manage releases and to control the 
concurrent editing of source files among multiple authors.
CVS allows triggers to enable/log/control various 
operations and works well over a wide area network.
