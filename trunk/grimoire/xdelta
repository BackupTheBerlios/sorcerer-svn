xdelta is a program designed to compute changes between files.
These changes (deltas) are similar to the output of the diff
program in that they may be used to store and transmit only 
the changes between files.  However, unlike diff, the output 
of Xdelta is not expressed in a human-readable format.  
Xdelta can also also apply these deltas to a copy of the
original file.  Xdelta uses a fast, linear algorithm and 
performs well on both binary and text files.
