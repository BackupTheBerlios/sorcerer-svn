popt library is for parsing command line options.
Some specific advantages of popt are no global variables
(allowing multiple passes in parsing argv),
parsing an arbitrary array of argv-style elements
(allowing parsing of command-line-strings from any source),
a standard method of option aliasing,
ability to exec external option filters,
and automatica generation of help and usage messages.'
