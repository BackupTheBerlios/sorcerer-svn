stream << EOF
popt library is for parsing command line options.
Some specific advantages of popt are no global variables 
(allowing multiple passes in parsing argv), 
parsing an arbitrary array of argv-style elements 
(allowing parsing of command-line-strings from any source),
a standard method of option aliasing, 
ability to exec external option filters, 
and automatica generation of help and usage messages.
