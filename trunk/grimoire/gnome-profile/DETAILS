GNOME is the GNU Network Object Model Environment. 
This project is building a complete, user-friendly 
desktop based entirely on free software.  This desktop 
consists of small utilities and larger applications that 
share a consistent look and feel.  It uses the GTK+2 as
the GUI toolkit for all GNOME-compliant applications.
This profile installs gnome programs.
