with info    cite 'tools for use with the Bochs emulator
bochstools is a collection of scripts and programs
to be used together with the Bochs emulator.
The main goal is to provide a more Unix-like
interface to the emulator and to enable access
to Bochs disk images from outside of Bochs.
This project makes it very simple to copy
an existing OS installation to a Bochs image
(as long as Linux has write access to the relevant file system).'
