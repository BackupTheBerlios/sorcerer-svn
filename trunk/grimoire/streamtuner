SHOUTcast and Live365.

With streamtuner, you can:

    * Browse the SHOUTcast Yellow Pages
    * Browse the Live365 directory
    * Browse the Xiph.org (aka icecast.org, aka Oddsock) directory
    * Browse the basic.ch DJ mixes
    * Manage your local music collection, with full support for ID3 and
      Vorbis metadata editing
    * Listen to streams, browse their web page, or record them using programs
      such as Streamripper
    * Implement new directory handlers as tiny Python scripts or as
      dynamically loadable modules written in C
    * Retain your favourite streams by bookmarking them
    * Manually add streams to your collection'
