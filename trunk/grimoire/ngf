      DESC="ngf or Nihon-go Flash teaches Japaneese reading/writing.
Nihon-go Flash is meant for beginners and 
intermediates learning to read Japanese writing.
Currently only Hiragana and Katakana are supported, 
and it does not require any Japanese specific 
fonts or language settings.
It is broken into two programs: 
kana_begin for starting off learning 
the basics of Hiragana and Katakana, 
and kana_drill to help test your 
memory of what you have learned."
