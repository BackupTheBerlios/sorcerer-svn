      DESC="schedutils provides chrt, irqset, lsrt, and taskset.
schedutils take advantage of the scheduler family of
syscalls that Linux implements across various kernels.
These system calls implement interfaces for scheduler-related
parameters such as CPU affinity and real-time attributes.
The standard UNIX utilities do not provide support
for these interfaces, thus this package.
The programs that are included in this
package are chrt, irqset, lsrt, and taskset.
Together with nice and renice (not included),
they allow full control of process scheduling parameters."
