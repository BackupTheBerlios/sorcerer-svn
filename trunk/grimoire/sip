      desc 'tool for creating Python bindings for C and C++ libraries
One of the features of Python that makes it so powerful is
the ability to take existing libraries, written in C or C++,
and make them available as Python extension modules. Such
extension modules are often called bindings for the library.

SIP is a tool that makes it very easy to create Python bindings
for C and C++ libraries. It was originally developed to creat
PyQt, the Python bindings for the Qt toolkit, but can be used
to create bindings for any C or C++ library.

SIP comprises a code generator and a Python module. The code
generator processes a set of specification files and generates
C or C++ code which is then compiled to create the bindings
extension module. The SIP Python module provides support
functions to the automatically generated code.'
