      desc 'mailx was formerly known as nail.
mailx is derived from Berkeley Mail and provides
the functionality of the System V and POSIX mailx commands.
Additional features include support for
MIME, IMAP (including caching and disconnected use),
POP3, SMTP, S/MIME, international character sets, maildir folders,
message threading, powerful search methods, scoring,
and a Bayesian junk mail filter.
Mailx can be used as a mail batch language
in nearly the same way as it is used interactively.
It can thus act as a mailbox filter,
can fetch mail from remote accounts,
and can send files as attachments.'
