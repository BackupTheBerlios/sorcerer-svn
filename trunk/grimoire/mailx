      DESC="Heirloom mailx (formerly known as nail) 
is derived from Berkeley Mail and provides the functionality 
of the System V and POSIX mailx commands. Additional features 
include support for MIME, IMAP (including caching and disconnected 
use), POP3, SMTP, S/MIME, international character sets, maildir 
folders, message threading, powerful search methods, scoring, and a 
Bayesian junk mail filter. Mailx can be used as a mail batch language 
in nearly the same way as it is used interactively. It can thus act 
as a mailbox filter, can fetch mail from remote accounts, and can 
send files as attachments.
