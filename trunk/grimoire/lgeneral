      desc 'port of Panzer General, a turn based strategy game

lgeneral is a turn-based strategy engine heavily inspired by Panzer General.
You play single scenarios or whole campaigns
turn by turn against a human player or the AI.
Entrenchment, rugged defense, defensive fire,
surprise contacts, surrender, unit supply,
weather influence, reinforcements and other
implementations contribute to the
tactical and strategic depth of the game.'
