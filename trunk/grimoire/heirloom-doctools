      desc 'heirloom-doctools provides troff, nroff, and related utilities.
It provides utilities used to format maual pages and 
other documentation for output on terminals and printers.
They are portable and enhanced versions of the 
utilities released by Sun as part of OpenSolaris,
which are a variant of ditroff which 
descended from the historical Unix troff.
While consuming relatively few system resources,
troff provides advanced typographical features
such as kerning, tracking, and hanging characters.
Internationalized hyphenation, paper sizes, and UTF-8 input are supported.'
