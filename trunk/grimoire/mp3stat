      DESC="mp3stat displays bitrates of mp3 and ogg files
mp3stats shows differences  caused by encoders
on the same audio file or between codecs. It only 
looks at the bitstream differences of bitrates,  
it in no way capable of showing which encoder is
better or which codec is better.  It's merely an 
informational tool for someone interested in knowing 
where an encoder is putting larger bitrates and
smaller bitrates throughout the file.  How those 
change depending on quality levels and how different 
encoders handle certain audio files."
