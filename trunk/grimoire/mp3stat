      desc 'mp3stat displays bitrates of mp3 and ogg files
mp3stats shows differences  caused by encoders
on the same audio file or between codecs.
It only looks at the bitstream differences of bitrates,
it in no way capable of showing which encoder is
better or which codec is better.
It is merely an informational tool for detecting
larger bitrates and smaller bitrates throughout the file.
How those change depending on quality levels
and how different encoders handle certain audio files.'
