      desc 'framework for testing other programs
Its purpose is to provide a single front end for all tests.
Think of it  as a custom library of Tcl procedures
crafted to support writing a test harness.
A Test Harness is the testing infrastructure that
is created to support a specific program or tool.
Each program can have multiple testsuites,
all supported by a single test harness.
DejaGnu is written in Expect, 
which in turn uses Tcl -- Tool command language.'
