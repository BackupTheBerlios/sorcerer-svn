      desc 'whaw is a window manager independent tiling window placer.
It uses advanced tiling algorithms and an intuitive
user interface to quickly lay out windows without having to
replace or modify the set up of your window manager of choice.
whaw is meant to augment the capabilities of your current
window manager, not supplant them.'
