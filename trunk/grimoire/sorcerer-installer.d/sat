msg "\
Greetings and welcome.
For a skilled system administrator, also called SA,
installation of Sorcerer Modern Magic
provides no challenge when using the menu driven installer.
Manual installation from a command line is also possible.
However, be certain to also transfer files that are required
yet only provided on the initramfs.

However, some people are eager
to both attempt and surmount
the challenge of installation
with little or no prior training.
Two people successfully accomplish it."

msg "\
For the benefit of everyone else
this exam identifies important system administrator lore
that is missing from minds of future Sorcerer SAs.
Then the missing lore is uploaded
using the protocol of English
through the eyeballs and into the brain.

SA lore is knowledge that SA possess.
However, merely gaining lore
does not constitute SA training.
Therefore, unfortunately not everyone
will achieve immediate competence
after reading documentation.
However, reading and learning the lore
will advance potentials SAs closer
to the goal of becoming competent SAs.
Hopefully, more misunderstood words and
confusion will be eliminated rather than created."

msg "\
Menu driven installation is easily accomplished
by anyone that understand all of the vernacular.
Howver, choosing an appropriate installation type
requires experience.
If uncertain, baffled, or overwhelmed by the exam
then installing Sorcerer Sentient provides
a nearly no questions asked installation
of a Sorcerer Sentient workstation.

The operating system can be
re-installed at any time.
Therefore, perfection is an optional goal
for the first few installation attempts.
"

msg "\
Please answer questions honestly.
Please do not answer with an uncertain guess.
A gold star is NOT awarded
for answering all questions correctly."

msg "\
Skipping or aborting the exam
to proceed to the menu driven installer
is immediate tacit consent that
any impass experienced while installing
is entirely caused by the computer opeartor's ignorance
and that software developers remain blameless.

Install/Rescue images come without warranty.
SAs are not included.
This is a distribution of free and open source software.
This is not free computer based system administrator training."

msg "\
Congratulations on completing the exam.
Hopefully, sufficient lore was gained or verified
such that installation should present no insumountable problems.
Therefore, no wish of good luck is required.
The magic of the SA belongs
to those who can wield the lore.

Installtion of a console based Sorcerer Modern Magic
requires less than 30 minutes to accomplish.
Installation of a Sorcerer Sentient KDE/xorg workstation
might require an hour or longer depending upon Internet bandwidth.
Prepare water and nutritional supplies if needed.  :)
