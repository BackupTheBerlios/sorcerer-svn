      desc 'convert between UTF-8 Unicode and 29 7-bit ASCII
equivalents including:
hexadecimal and decimal HTML and SGML numeric character references,
\u-escapes, standard hexadecimal, raw hexadecimal, and RFC2396 URI format.
Such ASCII equivalents are useful for entering Unicode in program source or
in programs that are not 8-bit safe, and for testing and debugging.
Several options allow Unicode to be converted
to approximately equivalent ASCII, e.g. by stripping diacritics.
An optional GUI is provided.'
