      DESC="uni2ascii and ascii2uni convert between UTF-8 Unicode and 29 7-bit ASCII equivalents
 including: hexadecimal and decimal HTML and SGML numeric character references,
 \u-escapes, standard hexadecimal, raw hexadecimal, and RFC2396 URI format.
 Such ASCII equivalents are useful for entering Unicode in program source or
 in programs that are not 8-bit safe, and for testing and debugging. Several
 options allow Unicode to be converted to approximately equivalent ASCII,
 e.g. by stripping diacritics. An optional GUI is provided."
