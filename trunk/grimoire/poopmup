      DESC="poopmup is a bird simulator shoot-em-up game.
poopmup is a game, a sort of a shoot-em-up, but with a twist.
As a child, you where tortured in the playground.
You were a victim of the highschool hierarchy.
You hacked hours on end, and built a
machine that transformed you into a bird.
You are now free (as in speech) to fly
around the city and poop on passers-by."
