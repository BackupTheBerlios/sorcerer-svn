      desc 'reports information about installed hardware
It gathers information as reported by BIOS according to SMBIOS/DMI standard.
This information typically includes system manufacturer,
model name, serial number, BIOS version, asset tag as well
as a lot of other details of varying level of interest and
reliability depending on the manufacturer.
This will often include usage status for the CPU sockets,
expansion slots (e.g. AGP, PCI, ISA) and memory module slots,
and the list of I/O ports (e.g. serial, parallel, USB).'
