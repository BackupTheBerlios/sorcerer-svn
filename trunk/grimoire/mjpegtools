      DESC="mjpegtools contain video record and playback tools and library.
The mjpeg programs are a set of tools that can do
recording of videos and playback, simple cut-and-paste
editing and the MPEG compression of audio and video under Linux.

Recording is supported for the Zoran based cards
like the Buz (Iomega), DC10 (MIRO, Pinnacle),
Matrox Marvel cards and the LML33 (Linux Media Labs).
The recorded videos can be converted to MPEG streams.
The software playback of MPEG streams works
with almost every player and every OS.
You can produce special forms of MPEG streams
like VCD (Video CD) and SVCD for hardware playback."
