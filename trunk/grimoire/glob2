Globulation is an innovative high quality real-time 
strategy which minimizes micro-management by 
automatically assigning tasks to the units.
The player has to choose the number of units 
they want for the different tasks, and the units 
will do their best to satisfy the requests.
This allows the player to manage more units and to focus on the strategy.
