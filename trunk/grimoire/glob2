      desc 'real-time strategy game
Globulation is an innovative high quality real-time
strategy which minimizes micro-management by
automatically assigning tasks to the units.
The player has to choose the number of units
they want for the different tasks, and the units
will do their best to satisfy the requests.
This allows the player to manage more units and to focus on the strategy.'
