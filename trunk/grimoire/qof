      desc 'qof provides the Query Object Framework.
The Query Object Framework is a set of C Language
utilities for performing generic structured complex
queries on a set of data held by a set of C/C++ objects.
This framework is unique in that it does NOT require SQL
or any database at all to perform the query.
Thus, it allows programmers to add query support to their
applications without having to hook into an SQL Database.

Basically this can present SQL style views of data
without a database server and without the data being
within a database server.'
