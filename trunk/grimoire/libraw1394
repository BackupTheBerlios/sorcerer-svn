libraw1394 provides an API to the Linux IEEE1394 (firewire) driver.
IEEE1394 (firewire) has many uses, one common one is
video capture from a camcorder using dvgrab or kino.
To use this library and any programs which rely upon
it you MUST have the IEEE 1394 kernel driver modules available.
When you rebuild the kernel will want
to select the following, as modules:

[M]   IEEE 1394 (FireWire support)
------------------------------
[M]   Texas Instruments PCILynx support
[M]   OHCI-1394 support
[M]   OHCI-1394 Video support
[M]   SBP-2 support (Harddisks etc.)
[M]   Raw IEEE1394 I/O Support

Finally, you will need to add users authorized to access the IEEE1394
(firewire) hardware to the firewire group in /etc/group.'
