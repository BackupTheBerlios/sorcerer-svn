swapd is a dynamic swapping manager for Linux.
It provides the system with as much swap space 
(virtual memory) as is required at a particular
time by dynamicly creating swap files.
This is more convinient than using fixed 
swapfiles and/or partitions because they 
(a) are unused most of the time and are 
just taking up disk space; and (b) provide 
a limited amount of virtual memory.
