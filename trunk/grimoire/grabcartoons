      desc 'grabcartoons is a comic-summarizing utility.
grabcartoons is for viewing comics on the web.
To avoid depriving free comic web sites of
their well-deserved traffic, grabcartoons
does not download the comics to the local machine.
Instead, it creates a page with links
to the comics at their original locations.
Therefore, when a page generated by
grabcartoons is viewed, the comics are
downloaded from their original pages and
not from local copies. Furthermore, the link
to the graphics are extracted from comics
web pages, which grabcartoons downloads when it runs.
Finally, each comic in a grabcartoons-generated
page is a link to the original web page.'
