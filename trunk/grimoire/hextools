reversible hexdump is a hexdump/hex2bin-toolkit that dumps
to a special readable and reversible hexadecimal byte-dump, 
where you can not only change bytes, but also insert or delete bytes.
It has a flush-switch, where it will output
hexbytes for each single char it reads.
This is especially useful (imho) for watching output
from slow devices (e.g., serial devices like mice).
The hex2bin-utility (the reverse-hexdump) not only
accepts hexbytes for input, but also double-quoted
strings with most of the escape-chars known from C
and makes good attempts at undumping even hexdumps
with repetition-lines (a * on its own line).'
