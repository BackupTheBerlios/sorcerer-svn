      LONG="
sqlite is a C library that implements an SQL database engine.
A large subset of SQL92 is supported.
A complete database is stored in a single disk file.
Applications that link against SQLite can enjoy the 
power and flexiblity of an SQL database without the 
administrativehassles of supporting a separate database server.
Because it omits the client-server interaction overhead 
and writes directly to disk, SQLite is also faster than 
the big database servers for most operations.
