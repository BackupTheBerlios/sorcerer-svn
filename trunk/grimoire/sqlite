      DESC="sqlite is a SQL engine in a C library.
sqlite is a C library that implements an SQL database engine.
A large subset of SQL92 is supported.
A complete database is stored in a single disk file.
Applications that link against SQLite can enjoy the
power and flexiblity of an SQL database without the
administrativehassles of supporting a separate database server.
Because it omits the client-server interaction overhead
and writes directly to disk, SQLite is also faster than
the big database servers for most operations."
