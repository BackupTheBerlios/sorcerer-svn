  CATEGORY="graphic"
 ATTRIBUTE="console library broken"
# When it has support for the ncurses library the
# library aalib installs is not linked with the ncurses library
# and therefore it can cause problems when SDL is compiled with
# the optional requirement of aalib and
# a program that is attempting to compile that requires
# the SDL library tries to compile it but then ends up
# with unresolved symbols because it did not explicitly
# link with ncurses library using the -lncurses.
# To make a long story short you probably won't want to use aalib
# so just leave it with the attribute broken until
# there is a fixed release of the source.
