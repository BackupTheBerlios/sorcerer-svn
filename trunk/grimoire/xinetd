with info    cite 'replacement for inetd, the internet services daemon
xinetd is a replacement for inetd,
the internet services daemon.
Anybody can use it to start servers
that do not require privileged ports
because xinetd does not require that
the services in its configuration
file be listed in /etc/services.
It can do access control on all
services based on the address of
the remote host and time of access.
Access control works on all services,
whether multi-threaded or single-threaded
and for both the TCP and UDP protocols.
xinetd supports both internal access
control, and the use of the libwrap library.
IPv6 with access control is also supported.'
