xinetd is a replacement for inetd, 
the internet services daemon.
Anybody can use it to start servers 
that don't require privileged ports 
because xinetd does not require that 
the services in its configuration 
file be listed in /etc/services.
It can do access control on all 
services based on the address of 
the remote host and time of access.
Access control works on all services, 
whether multi-threaded or single-threaded 
and for both the TCP and UDP protocols.
xinetd supports both internal access 
control, and the use of the libwrap library.
IPv6 with access control is also supported.
