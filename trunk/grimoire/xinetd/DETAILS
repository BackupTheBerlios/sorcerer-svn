xinetd is a replacement for inetd, the internet services daemon.
Anybody can use it to start servers that don't require privileged 
ports because xinetd does not require that the services in its
configuration file be listed in /etc/services.  It can do access 
control on all services based on the address of the remote host 
and time of access.  Access control works on all services, whether
multi-threaded or single-threaded and for both the TCP and UDP
protocols. xinetd supports both internal access control, and the 
use of the libwrap library.  IPv6 with access control is also 
supported.
