      DESC="libungif is a library for uncompressed GIF images.

libungif is a library for reading and writing gif images.
The save functionality uses an uncompressed gif algorithm 
to avoid the Unisys LZW patent.
This library is based heavily on Eric Raymond's libgif and
implements a superset of that_library's API."
