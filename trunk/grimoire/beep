      DESC="beep the pc speaker in any number of ways.

Different sounds can indicate different events.
While it can be run quite happily on the commandline, 
it's intended place of residence is within shell/perl scripts, 
notifying the user when something interesting occurs.
Of course, it has no notion of what's interesting, 
but it's real good at the notifying part.
