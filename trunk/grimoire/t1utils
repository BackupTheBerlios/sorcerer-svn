t1utils contains six programs that manipulate PostScript
Type 1 fonts. There are programs that change PFB (binary)
fonts into PFA (ASCII) format (and back), that translate
fonts into a disassembled human-readable format (and back),
and that translate Macintosh Type 1 fonts into PFB or PFA (and back).'
