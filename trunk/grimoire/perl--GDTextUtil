with info    cite 'perl--GDTextUtil contains text utilities for use with the GD drawing package
This package provides three modules that make it possible to work with
internal GD fonts as well as TrueType fonts, without having to worry
about different interface functions to call. Apart from an abstract
interface to all font types and strings for GD, this library also
provides some utility in aligning and wrapping your string.
GD::Text:
    Provides information about a font, irrespective of whether the font
    is a TTF or builtin font.
GD::Text::Align
    Align a string around a coordinate, left, right, center, top, bottom
    or center.
GD::Text::Wrap
    Wrap a long string between a right and left margin, starting at a
    certain y coordinate. Layout the text flush left, flush right,
    center, or justified.'
