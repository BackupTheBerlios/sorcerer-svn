# on uClibc:
# routines.c:149: error: 'sys_siglist' undeclared
# Accoding to uClibc
# "Support sys_siglist[] (bsd-compat)"
# Answer Y if you want to support sys_siglist[].
# WARNING!  In the future, support for sys_siglist[] may be unavailable
# Therefore, we will leave this broke and leave out (bsd-compat) support from uClibc
# Probably nobody has ever used the installed programs from procinfo on Sorcerer?
# However, one could also look at /proc directly if they wanted.
# It compiles fine on glibc, but was not intended for linux 2.6 kernels
# and will probably never be updated again since
# procinfo-ng replaces procinfo
