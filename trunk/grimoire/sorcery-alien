      desc 'sorcery-alien reports unexpected files.

sorcery-alien examines parts of the filesystem
where the installed files are expected
to belong to installed spells.
Then, it reports files that are found which
no installed spell claims ownership.

alien files are not necessarily misplaced or harmful files.
However, the SA should be aware of what alien files exist
and why each alien file exists.
Also should an alien file be undesirable
then the SA should decide whether to move or remove the alien file.

The sorcery-alien spell only tracks
aliens files but never removes files.
Once installed sorcery-alien will recast monthly.
Please execute
# augur compile alien
To view the list of alien files.'
