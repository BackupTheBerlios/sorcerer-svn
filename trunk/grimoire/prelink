# prelink 20100106 seems okay to use because
# it will not modify ELF libraries implicitly
# if a path to those ELF libraries is not contained
# in prelink's configuration file
# and therefore will only prelink ELFs
# that are specified on the prelink command line

# prelink version 20100106 corrupts programs
# when glibc version 2.13 is installed
# makes some programs segmentation fault

# never delete this spell
# we must remain aware of the danger of prelinking
