cat << EOF
prelink is a program which modifies ELF shared libraries 
and ELF dynamically linked binaries, so that the time 
which dynamic linker needs for their relocation at 
startup significantly decreases and also due to fewer 
relocations the run-time memory consumption decreases 
too (especially the number of unshareable pages).
