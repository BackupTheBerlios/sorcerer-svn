      DESC="heirloom toolchest is a collection of standard Unix utilities.
heriloom is a collection of Unix utilities originally from Caldera.
It was derived from original Unix material released
as open source by Caldera and contains up to four
versions of each utility corresponding to SVID3/SVR4,
SVID4/ SVR4.2MP, POSIX.2/SUSV2, and 4BSD (SVR4 /usr/ucb).
It contains support for lines of arbitrary length and in
many cases binary input data, support for multibyte
character sets, especially UTF-8, and more than 100
individual utilities including bc, cpio, diff, ed, file,
find, grep, man, nawk, oawk, ps, sed, sort, spell, and tar.
Extensive documentation is included.

Use heirloom toolchest if you want, but do not 
uninstall coreutils because none of the binaries
installed by heirloom are protected against reaping,
and sorcery tools and other shell scripts may not
work correctly with the heirloom supplied ELFs."
