with info    cite 'graphical directory tree analyzer
Baobab is able to scan either specific directories or the whole filesystem
in order to give the user a graphical tree representation
including each directory size or percentage in the branch.
It also auto-detects in real-time any change made to the home 
folder as far as any mounted/unmounted device.'
