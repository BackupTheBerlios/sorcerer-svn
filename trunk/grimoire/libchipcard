with info    cite 'library for accessing chipcards via terminals/readers
libchipcard is a C++ framework for easy access to
chipcards/smartcards via chip card terminals/readers.
It uses the CTAPI library provided by the manufacturer
of the reader and provides a filesystem on memory chip cards.
It works under Linux, FreeBSD, and Windows, and has been
tested with Towitoko and Kobil readers even in parallel.'
