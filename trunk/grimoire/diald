      DESC="diald dials up your ISP on demand.

diald is an intelligent link management tool originally named 
for its ability to control dial-on-demand network connections. 

Diald monitors traffic through a network interface 
and presents connection and utilization details to 
monitor programs such as dctrl. 

Diald can be configured to bring on-demand links 
up and down as required - either by user request 
or by specific types of packet. 

Diald is not limited to traditional on-demand 
links such as modems and ISDN.
It can be used to manage any network interface.
You could, for instance, use it to manage a WAN 
interface which is chargable on a per-packet basis.
