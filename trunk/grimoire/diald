      desc 'diald dials up your ISP on demand.

diald is an intelligent link management tool originally named
for its ability to control dial-on-demand network connections.

Diald monitors traffic through a network interface
and presents connection and utilization details to
monitor programs such as dctrl.

Diald can be configured to bring on-demand links
up and down as required - either by user request
or by specific types of packet.

Diald is not limited to traditional on-demand
links such as modems and ISDN.
It can be used to manage any network interface.
You could, for instance, use it to manage a WAN
interface which is chargable on a per-packet basis.'
