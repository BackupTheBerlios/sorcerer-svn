sylpheed-claws is a gtk+ based, lightweight, and fast email client.
Almost all commands are accessible with the keyboard.
It also has many features such as multiple accounts,
POP3/APOP support, thread display, and multipart MIME.
The messages are managed in the MH format, so you'll
be able to use it together with another mailer that
uses the MH format."
