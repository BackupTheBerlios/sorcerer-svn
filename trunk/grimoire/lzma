      desc 'lzma is a high performance compressor.
lzma implements an algorithm that typically performs better than bzip2,
although it uses a lot of memory.
It is a standalone tool for compressing and decompressing files.

Version 4.32.2 does not yet create lzma compressed files with
designated magic at the beginning.
Full integration for lzma for use with Sorcerer may have to wait
until lzma files can be properly identified by using file.'
