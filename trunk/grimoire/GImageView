 Playing animation files
 
 It can play movie and sound files by using Xine library and MPlayer. Supported movie/sound formats are depended on these software.

    * AVI (MS-MPEG4, DivX, MotionJPEG, Cinepack and so on...)
    * MPEG1, MPEG2, MPEG4, MPEG1 Audio Layer 3
    * Quick Time
    * Real Media
    * Ogg Vorbis
    * Any other unknown types...

It can also create thumbnails, but it has also following limits.

When use Xine :

    * Thumbnail can only be created when play the movie on image view.
    * It can grab any frame.
    * CPU and Disk load is light.

When use MPlayer :

    * Thumbnail can be created both when open directory and when play the movie.
    * It can grab any frame, but it isn't often same with the frame displayed on image view.
    * CPU and Disk load is heavy (use temporary file).
