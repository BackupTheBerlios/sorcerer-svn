Gdkxft transparently adds anti-aliased font support to gtk+-1.2
Once you have installed it, you can run any (well, nearly any) 
existing gtk+ binary and see anti-aliased fonts in the gtk widgets.
You don't need to recompile gtk+ or your applications.

This will not work with gnome2!
It will prevent a normal login via GDM.
