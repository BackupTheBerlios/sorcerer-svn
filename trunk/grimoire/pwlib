      DESC="pwlib is the portable windows library.
pwlib is a moderately large class library that was
originally designed as a method to produce applications
that run on both Microsoft Windows and Unix/X11 systems.
It includes classes for I/O portability, multi-threading
portability, aid in producing Unix daemons and NT
services portably, and all sorts of Internet protocols.
It also offers basic container classes such as arrays,
linear lists, sorted lists (RB Tree), and dictionaries
(hash tables) which were all created before the STL.
This library is used by the OpenH323 library."
