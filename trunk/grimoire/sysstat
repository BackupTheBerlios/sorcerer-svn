      DESC="systat contains sar, mpstat, and iostat system statistics reporting commands.
The sar command collects and reports system activity information.
This information can also be saved in a
system activity file for future inspection.
The iostat command reports CPU statistics
and I/O statistics for tty devices and disks.
The statistics reported by sar concern I/O
transfer rates, paging activity, process-related activites,
interrupts, network activity, memory and swap space utilization,
CPU utilization, kernel activities, and TTY statistics, among others.
Both UP and SMP machines are fully supported."
