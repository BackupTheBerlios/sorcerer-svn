# All 1.2.x releases after 1.2.40 are security fixes.
# 1.2.41 failed compilation

# Version 1.4.0 is not a drop in replacement for libpng 1.2.x
# Due to expected compatibility problems
# holding off on testing and deployment of libpng 1.4.1
# try in summer 2010  :)

# 1.4.3 was a security release?
