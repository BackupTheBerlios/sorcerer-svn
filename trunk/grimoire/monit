      desc 'utility for managing and monitoring everything
Monit conducts automatic maintenance and repair and can execute
meaningful causal actions in error situations. E.g. monit can
start a process if it does not run, restart a process if it
does not respond and stop a process if it uses to much resources.
You may use monit to monitor files, directories and
devices for changes, such as timestamp changes,
checksum changes or size changes.
You can also use monit to monitor remote hosts;
monit can ping a remote host and can
check port connections and protocols.'
