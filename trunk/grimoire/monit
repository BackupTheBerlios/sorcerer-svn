      DESC=("monit is a utility for managing and monitoring everything"
"Monit conducts automatic maintenance and repair and can execute meaningful 
causal actions in error situations. E.g. monit can start a process if it does 
not run, restart a process if it does not respond and stop a process if it 
uses to much resources. You may use monit to monitor files, directories and 
devices for changes, such as timestamp changes, checksum changes or size changes.
You can also use monit to monitor remote hosts; monit can ping a remote host and
can check port connections and protocols.
