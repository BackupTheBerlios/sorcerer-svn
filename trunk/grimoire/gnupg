      DESC="gnupg is a tool for secure secure communication and data storage.
gnupg (the GNU Privacy Guard) is GNU's tool
for secure communication and data storage.
It can be used to encrypt data and to create digital signatures.
It includes an advanced key management facility and is compliant
with the proposed OpenPGP Internet standard as described in RFC2440.
As such, it is meant to be compatible with PGP from NAI, Inc.
Because it does not use any patented algorithms,
it can be used without any restrictions."
