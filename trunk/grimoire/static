Statically linked executable files for command line utilities
tend to require a magnitude more disk space
and a magnitude more RAM when run
than dynamically linked counterparts.
However, statically linked programs can begin executation
sooner than dynamically linked programs
When dynamically linked programs run
then the dynamic linker ld.so runs first
utilizing CPU cycles on resolving library dependencies.
Statically linked programs do not run ld.so.
Therefore, statically linked programs when executed frequently
can run and exit twice perhaps thrice faster
than dynamically linked counterparts.'
