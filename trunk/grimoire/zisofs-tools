zisofs-tools provides tools for creatinga compressed ISO9660 filesystem.
The zisofs filesystem is an extension to the ISO9660
filesystem that allows files, on a file-by-file basis,
to be stored compressed and decompressed in real time.
zisofs-tools contains the tools necessary to create
such a compressed ISO9660 filesystem and to read
compressed files on a legacy system.'
