The smartmontools package contains two utility programs 
(smartctl and smartd) to control and monitor storage 
systems using the Self-Monitoring, Analysis and Reporting 
Technology System (S.M.A.R.T.) built into most modern ATA 
and SCSI hard disks.
It is derived from the smartsuite package, and includes 
support for ATA/ATAPI-5 disks.
It should run on any modern Linux system.
