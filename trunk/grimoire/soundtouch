      desc 'soundtouch is a library for modifying audio.
The soundtouch library can change pitch and tempo of digitized audio.

From the soundtouch webpage:
*  Tempo (time-stretch): Changes the sound to play at faster or
   slower speed than original, without affecting the sound pitch.
*  Pitch (key) : Changes the sound pitch or key,
   without affecting the sound tempo or speed.
*  Playback Rate : Changes both the sound tempo and pitch,
   as if an LP disc was played at wrong RPM rate.

The soundtouch library includes also an example utility soundstretch.
soundstretch processes .wav audio files with command-line interface.'
