linux is a clone of the Unix kernel, 
written from scratch by Linus Torvalds 
with assistance from a loosely-knit 
team of hackers across the Net.
It aims towards POSIX and Single 
UNIX Specification compliance.
It has all the features you would 
expect in a modern fully-fledged 
Unix kernel, including true multitasking, 
virtual memory, shared libraries, 
demand loading, shared copy-on-write 
executables, proper memory management, 
and TCP/IP networking.
