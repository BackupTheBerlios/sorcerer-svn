linux is a clone of the Unix kernel,
written from scratch by Linus Torvalds
with assistance from a loosely-knit
team of hackers across the Net.
It aims towards POSIX and Single
UNIX Specification compliance.
It has all the features expected
in a modern fully-fledged Unix kernel
including true multitasking, virtual memory,
shared libraries, demand loading,
shared copy-on-write executables,
proper memory management, and TCP/IP networking.

The version of linux to install
can be selected by running
# augur progress
command on the spell linux-source.
The spell linux is a profile spell.
Casting it helps ensure that all portions
of linux are properly installed.'
