It supports multiple tracks, multiple outputs,
and 8, 16, or 24/32-bit samples.
It can read and write many audio formats through a number of
supported file format libraries (such as AudioFile, libsndfile,
and libmp3lame), and it can extract audio from a variety of
video files through FFmpeg.
It supports OSS, ALSA, or JACK for playback/capture,
as well as a large number of high-quality audio
effects through the LADSPA plugin architecture."
