The following long description comes from the davfs2 hompeage summary.

Web Distributed Authoring and Versioning (WebDAV),
an extension to the HTTP-protocol, 
allows authoring of resources on a remote web server.
davfs2 provides the ability to access such resources like a typical filesystem,
allowing for use by standard applications with no built-in support for WebDAV.

davfs2 is designed to fully integrate
into the filesystem semantics of Unix-like systems (mount, umount, etc.).
davfs2 makes mounting by unprivileged users as easy and secure as possible.'
