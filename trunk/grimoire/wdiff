with info    cite 'front end to diff for comparing on a word per word basis
It compares two files, finding which words have been deleted
or added to the first in order to create the second.
It has many output formats and interacts well with terminals
and pagers (notably with less).
wdiff is particularily useful when two texts differ
only by a few words and paragraphs have been refilled.'
