      desc 'wdiff is a front end to diff for comparing on a word per word basis.
It compares two files, finding which words have been deleted 
or added to the first in order to create the second.  It has 
many output formats and interacts well with terminals and 
pagers (notably with less).  wdiff is particularily useful when 
two texts differ only by a few words and paragraphs have
been refilled.'
