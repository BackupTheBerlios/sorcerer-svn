      DESC="freeswan is an implementation of IPSEC & IKE for Linux.

freeswan is an implementation of IPSEC & IKE for Linux.
These services allow you to build secure 
tunnels through untrusted networks.
Everything passing through the untrusted net is 
encrypted by the IPSEC gateway machine and 
decrypted by the gateway at the other end.
The result is Virtual Private Network or VPN.
This is a network which is effectively private 
even though it includes machines at several 
different sites connected by the insecure Internet.
