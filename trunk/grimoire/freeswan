freeswan is an implementation of IPSEC & IKE for Linux.
These services allow you to build secure
tunnels through untrusted networks.
Everything passing through the untrusted net is
encrypted by the IPSEC gateway machine and
decrypted by the gateway at the other end.
The result is Virtual Private Network or VPN.
This is a network which is effectively private
even though it includes machines at several
different sites connected by the insecure Internet.'
