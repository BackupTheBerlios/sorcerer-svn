      desc 'bbkeys is a blackbox key grabber.
bbkeys is the keygrabber for the Blackbox window manager.
bbkeys handles all keybindings and keyboard shortcuts for Blackbox.
It uses Blackbox Image classes for rendering its look and feel, so
bbkeys will draw itself to match whatever Blackbox style is used.
It is highly configurable via the bbconf GUI utility, the included
bbkeysconf.pl perl script, or via hand-editing bbkeys config file.'
