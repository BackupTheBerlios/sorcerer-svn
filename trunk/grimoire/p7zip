      DESC="p7zip is a command line high compression ratio archiver.
Some types of sorcery compression requires p7zip.
sdelta upgrade patches are now available compressed
both by bzip2 and p7zip.
The p7zip sdelta upgrade patches may be up to 15% smaller
than the bzip2 compressed sdelta upgrade patches, however
p7zip is 5 or more times slower than bzip2 to compress,
but equally fast to decompress."
