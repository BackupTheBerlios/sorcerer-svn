mailutils contains a series of useful mail clients, servers and libraries.
These are the primary mail utilities of the GNU system.
It contains a POP3 server, an IMAP4 server, and a Sieve mail filter.
It also provides a POSIX mailx client and a collection of other tools.

Using pop3d or imap4d through stunnel has not
been tested with this spell and may not work.
If it does not, please fix and report it
or use pine SSL mail servers instead.'
