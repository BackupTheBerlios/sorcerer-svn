LFT (formerly FFT) is an alternative traceroute program for
displaying the route packets take to an IP network host/socket.
Unlike Van Jacobson traceroute, which is available
on almost every platform today, LFT uses TCP in order
to elicit ICMPTIME_EXCEEDEDs or other IP route data.
As a result, LFT often executes much faster and
sees behind some configurations of firewalls.
Its stateful engine lets the user know when it encounters
a stateful firewall or other interesting conditions.
It also does AS number and netblock name lookups en route.
Most importantly, LFT can trace specific TCP-based protocol
routes (not just IP) to assist network engineers with manual
fault isolation of network application problems.'
