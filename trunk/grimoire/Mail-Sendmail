      DESC="Mail::Sendmail : A simple module to send mail.

Mail::Sendmail : A simple module to send mail.

Simple platform independent e-mail from your perl script.
Only requires Perl 5 and a network connection.

After struggling for some time with various command-line
mailing programs which never did exactly what I wanted,
I put together this Perl only solution.

Mail::Sendmail contains mainly &sendmail, which
takes a hash with the message to send and sends it.
It is intended to be very easy to setup and use."
