      DESC="tar creates GNU tar archives.
Can create tar archives, as well as other forms of manipulation.
For example, you can use tar on previously created archives to
extract files, store additional files, or update or list files
which were already stored.
Tar can direct its output to available devices, files,
or other programs (using pipes); tar can even access
remote devices or files (as archives).
The program saves many files together into a single tape or
disk archive, and can restore individual files from the archive.
It includes multi-volume support, the ability to archive sparse files,
automatic archive compression/decompression, remote archives and
special features that allow 'tar' to be used for incremental and
full backups."
