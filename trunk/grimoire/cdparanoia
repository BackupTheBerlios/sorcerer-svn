      desc "cdparanoia is a cd ripper.
Cdparanoia is a Compact Disc Digital Audio (CDDA) 
extraction tool, commonly known on the net as a 'ripper'.
Cdparanoia will read correct, rock-solid audio data 
from inexpensive drives prone to misalignment, 
frame jitter and loss of streaming during atomic reads.
Cdparanoia will also read and repair data from CDs that 
have been damaged in some way."
