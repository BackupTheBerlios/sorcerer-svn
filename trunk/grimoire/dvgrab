dvgrab is a program which saves the audio and video data 
from an IEEE (firewire) digital source (camcorder, A/D 
video converter, digital VCR) into an AVI file.
These AVI files can then be processed further by other 
video editing programs available for Windows or Linux.
The advantages of using dvgrab for creating the AVI files are:
* Autosplit features 
* Several file formats (raw, dv1, dv2)
* Error recovery
