netdude is the NETwork DUmp data Displayer 
and Editor for tcpdump tracefiles.
It is a GUI-based tool that allows you to make 
detailed changes to packets in tcpdump tracefiles.
In particular, it can set the value of every 
field in IP, TCP, and UDP packet headers, copy, 
move, and delete packets in the tracefile, and 
fragment and reassemble IP packets. 
Netdude constantly communicates with a tcpdump 
process to update the familiar tcpdump output 
that corresponds to the trace, which means 
that any changes made to your local version 
of tcpdump are reflected in Netdude.
Netdude features a plugin architecture, and 
comes with a plugin for checksum correction 
in IP, TCP, and UDP and a dummy plugin.
Through the plugin mechanism, Netdude provides 
a good facility for writing tcpdump trace file filters.
Netdude supports plugins.
