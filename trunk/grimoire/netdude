      desc 'displays tcpbump trace files
netdude is the NETwork DUmp data Displayer
and Editor for tcpdump tracefiles.
It is a GUI-based tool that allows you to make
detailed changes to packets in tcpdump tracefiles.
In particular, it can set the value of every
field in IP, TCP, and UDP packet headers, copy,
move, and delete packets in the tracefile, and
fragment and reassemble IP packets.
Netdude constantly communicates with a tcpdump
process to update the familiar tcpdump output
that corresponds to the trace, which means
that any changes made to your local version
of tcpdump are reflected in Netdude.
Netdude features a plugin architecture, 
and comes with a plugin for checksum correction
in IP, TCP, and UDP and a dummy plugin.
Through the plugin mechanism, Netdude provides
a good facility for writing tcpdump trace file filters.
Netdude supports plugins.'
