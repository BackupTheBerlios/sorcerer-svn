      desc 'muhttpd is a small simple web server written in ASNI C.
It supports static pages, CGI, MIME type based handlers.
It drops privileges before accepting connections.
It can log received requests.

This spell has no boot scripts, because muhttpd would
probably be used to erect a website very quickly and
simply as opposed to running a more full featured webserver.
Also you could use the in-kernel webserver for hosting static pages.
If you want boot scripts for muhttpd
then please email the list and we will write them.'
