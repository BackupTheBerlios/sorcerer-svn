      DESC="muhttpd is a small simple web server written in ASNI C.
It supports static pages, CGI, MIMEtype based handlers.
It drops privileges before accepting connections.
It can log received requests.

This spell has no boot scripts, because
muhttpd would probably be used to erect
a website very quickly and simply as
opposed to running a more full featured
webserver.  Also you could use the in-
kernel webserver for hosting static pages.
If you want boot scripts for muhttpd,
please email the list and we will write them."
