      desc 'Twin-Panel filemanager.
Its twin-panel look follows in the
footsteps of the great file managers
of old such as GNU Midnight Commander(c)
and the Norton Commander(c) for DOS.
Krusader features an intuitive GUI,
complete drag and drop capability,
transparent handling of archives,
mimetype support, and more.'
