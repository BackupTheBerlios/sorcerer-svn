      desc 'daemon for managing and downloading certificate
revocation lists (CRLs) for X.509 certificates and
for downloading the certificates themselves.
Dirmngr also handles OCSP requests and
LDAP queries as an alternative to CRLs.
Dirmngr is either invoked internally by gpgsm
or when running as a system daemon through the
dirmngr-client tool.'
