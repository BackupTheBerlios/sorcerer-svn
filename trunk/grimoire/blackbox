      desc 'blackbox is a X11 window manager.
blackbox is yet another addition to the list of window managers for X.
It is written in C++, sharing no common code with
any other window manager (even though the graphics
implementation is similar to that of WindowMaker).
It features small code size, a fast interface with
simple menus, multiple workspaces, and decorated
windows , built-in graphics code to render solids,
gradients and bevels on the fly when needed, and more.'
