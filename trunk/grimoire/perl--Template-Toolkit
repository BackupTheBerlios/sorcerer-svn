The perl--Template-Toolkit is a collection of modules 
which implement a fast, flexible, powerfull
and extensible template processing system.
It was originally designed and remains primarily
useful for generating dynamic web content,
but it can be used equally well for processing
any other kind of text based documents:
HTML, XML, POD, PostScript, LaTeX, and so on.'
