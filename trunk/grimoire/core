# This spell may replace all functionality based upon
# the core attribute including the sustain feature
# Should libselinux, teTeX, or teTeX-texmf be core?
# Important spells not listed here may be required by sorcery
# or required by spells listed here or their requirements.
# Do not double list requirements because it makes sorcery
# indexing and requirement resolution unnecessarily slow.

# Some spells required for compilation,
# but not necessarily obvious are:
# XML-Parser bc bison perl
# and therefore are listed here.
