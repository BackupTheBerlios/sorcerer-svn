cpufreqd is a small daemon to adjust cpu speed and voltage
for kernels using any of the cpufreq drivers available.
The CpuFreq patch has been included in the 2.6 tree,
2.4 kernels have to be patched.

cpufreqd is meant to be a replacement of the
speedstep applet you can find in Windows.
It monitors battery level, AC state,
and running programs and adjusts the frequency
governor according to a set of rules specified
in the config file.'
