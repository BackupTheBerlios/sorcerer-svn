       DESC="cpufreqd adjusts the CPU frequency governor according to rules

cpufreqd is a small daemon to adjust cpu speed and 
voltage for kernels using any of the cpufreq drivers 
available. The CpuFreq patch has been included in 
the 2.6 tree, 2.4 kernels have to be patched.

cpufreqd is meant to be a replacement of the 
speedstep applet you can find in Windows. It 
monitors battery level, AC state, and running 
programs and adjusts the frequency governor 
according to a set of rules specified in the 
config file.
