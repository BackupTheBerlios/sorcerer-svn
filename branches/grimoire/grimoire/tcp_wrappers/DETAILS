tcp_wrappers
The tcp_wrappers package allows you to monitor and filter incoming
requests for the SYSTAT, FINGER, FTP, TELNET, RLOGIN, RSH, EXEC, TFTP,
TALK, and other network services.  It provides tiny daemon wrapper
programs that can be installed without any changes to existing software
or to existing configuration files.  The wrappers report the name of the
client host and of the requested service. The wrappers do not exchange
information with the client or server applications, and impose no
overhead on the actual conversation between the client and server
applications.
